    "text": "Cost of children's homes doubles but care can be poor, says report. The cost of residential care for vulnerable children in England has nearly doubled in five years but many children still do not receive appropriate care, says a report from the independent public spending watchdog. The National Audit Office (NAO) says councils on average spent £318,400 on each child placed in a children's home in the year ending March 2024. But these huge sums do not represent value for money, the report concludes. \"I do not know where the money is being spent,\" says Ezra Quinton, now 20, who recalls smashed windows and broken glass in the showers of one of the care homes he was placed in. Ezra, who now works with Become, a care leavers' charity, first went into care aged nine. Originally from Greater Manchester, he remembers being moved to a different home every few months, often many miles from where he originally lived. He thinks he had up to 60 different placements and although he has spent most of his life in Salford and Stockport, he has lived in Wales, Liverpool, Crewe and Leeds. His education was considerably disrupted but he did achieve C grades in all of his GCSEs. At one home the windows were boarded up because of smashed windows. \"We were told to wear shoes if we wanted to shower because they didn't clean up the glass properly,\" he told BBC News. The NAO report found rising costs were driven by a record number of children in care, the increasing complexity of their needs - and a profit driven market. In 2023-24 councils spent £3.1bn on residential placements, in a market the report  describes as \"dysfunctional\". It says councils are struggling to find enough appropriate placements, arguing that this allows many private care providers to cherry pick the children they take, based on how much support they need and how much profit this allows. The report draws on previous research which showed the 15 largest providers of children's homes making average profits of more than 22%. Report author Emma Wilson says several factors contribute to rising costs but with the overwhelming majority (84%) of children's homes run for profit: \"It's really important to get right that balance between supply of available care home places and demand.\" She wants the Department for Education to do more to oversee a market which she says is failing children in residential care. \"The NAO report concludes that the system of residential care for looked after children is not delivering value for money. On the one hand, costs have doubled to over three billion in the last five years, whilst many children are not in appropriate settings,\" Ms Wilson told BBC News. The report highlights how in March 2024 two thirds of children in residential care were in homes outside their local authority and almost half (49%) were more than 20 miles from home. The Department for Education said in a statement: \"Vulnerable children across the country have long been let down by years of drift and neglect in children's social care, which this report lays bare.\" It added that it was \"driving the largest ever reform of children's social care\" to \"break the cycle of crisis for children\" - pointing to its planned recruitment of more family help workers and new legislation aimed at ending profiteering in care homes. Clare Bracey, interim chief executive of Become, says the report \"is once again lifting the lid on the extortionate profits that are being made from providing homes for our most vulnerable children\". \"This market failure is leading to the most unforgivable failure [for] the futures of the children in our care... \"Children in care can't wait. Urgent steps must be taken now,\" she argues. But some small, privately run, children's homes insist they don't make excessive profits. Sara Milner, who set up Cherry Wood children's home in Surrey four years ago, after a career in local authority care, says staffing accounts for 80% of costs. \"The fees we charge the local authority are reflective of our direct costs and we make moderate margins... but obviously we have to be able to make profits to be a viable business and to offer security for the young people's future which is obviously really important when you're doing this type of work,\" she told BBC News. With demand for places high, she had also hoped to invest in a second children's home, but says current pressures, including rising costs and difficulties recruiting staff, mean that has been delayed. The government has already said it plans to limit the profits private companies can make, however the Children's Homes Association, which represents providers paying tax in the UK, argues that council-run homes can in fact be more expensive. \"We know that official data shows that local authority costs are higher,\" said the association's chief executive Mark Kerr. \"So if there's a value for money question then the independent sector arguably demonstrates more value for money than local authorities,\" he added. About 2,000 pupils in Sunderland will benefit from the partnership, education bosses say. The MP, Greg Stafford, says he has asked ministers why funding for the high needs budget is on hold. The government reduced the sum each child could receive for 2025/26, but has renewed the scheme. Simon Graham runs a school in Portsmouth that is part of a government project on attendance.

    "text": "What the NHS can learn from the European country that helped more people survive cancer. \"It was really bad – we had patients dying on the waiting lists – politicians were getting desperate.\" Jesper Fisker, chief executive of the Danish Cancer Society, is looking back 25 years - to the  moment Denmark decided to transform its approach to treating cancer. At that point, he says, the country did not have a strong record. \"It was a disaster. We saw Danish patients out of their own pocket paying for tickets to China to get all sorts of treatments – endangering their health.\" Some went to private hospitals in Germany that offered new treatments unavailable in Denmark. Back then, Denmark's record on cancer was low compared to other rich countries. But so was the UK's. From 1995 to 1999, Denmark's five-year survival rate for rectal cancer was essentially tied with the UK's, on around 48%, according to the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership, a research body. It put both nations well below countries like Australia, which had a 59% rate. Now, thanks to a bold plan, Denmark's performance on cancer has jumped ahead. By 2014, its five-year survival rate for rectal cancer had risen to 69%, close to Australia's. (The UK's rose too, but only to 62%.) Analysts think the trend has probably continued (though these are the most up-to-date figures available). And it's a similar story for other cancers, including colon, stomach, and lung. This success story has caught the attention of UK policymakers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting says that aspects of the Danish model are feeding into government plans. Some could well be included in a new long-term cancer plan for England, due to be published in the autumn. So, what's their secret, and what can the NHS learn from Denmark? Walking today into Herlev Hospital on the outskirts of Copenhagen makes for a different experience to arriving at an average NHS hospital. The foyer is hung with bright, vivid paintings by the Danish artist Poul Gernes. There are 65 in all. The philosophy is that endless white walls can unnerve patients, while colour can be a pleasant distraction from their problems. It is a sign of the attention Denmark has paid to even the atmosphere of hospitals - small, thoughtful touches, alongside investment in more traditional equipment. Dr Michael Andersen, a consultant radiologist and associate professor at the hospital, shows off a high-tech scanner, only the fourth of its kind used by any hospital around the world. Buying hospital equipment like this - particularly scanners - has also been central to Denmark's cancer strategy. \"In 2008 the government made the decision to make a heavy investment into scanner systems,\" Dr Andersen explains. \"They purchased between 30 and 60 - they're an integral part of the way we work.\" Particularly important for cancer are CT scanners, which look deep inside a person's body. Denmark now has about 30 of them per million people - the average of other rich countries stands at 25.9. The UK, meanwhile, lags way behind with just 8.8 scanners per million people, according to the 2021 figures. The investment in cancer equipment, according to experts, led to a huge expansion in diagnostic capacity in Denmark. Unless funding to meet increasing patient demand is made, they argue, England could continue to lag behind on the quality of care. This all comes despite the fact that Denmark's health spending hasn't seen a huge boost. Calculated by spending per head of the population, Denmark is ahead; but as a share of national income, its health spending is similar to, and in fact slightly below that of the UK's. This is just one part of a bold plan drawn up by Danish health leaders. Along with introducing new equipment, and rethinking the atmosphere of hospitals, they made it possible for patients to be treated with chemotherapy at home. New national standards also govern how quickly Danes must be treated. Following a referral, a cancer diagnosis has to be given within two weeks. Then, if treatment is required, it has to start within the two weeks of diagnosis. If these targets are not met patients have the right to transfer to another hospital - or, failing that, another country - whilst still being funded by the Danish health system. This is a contrast to the UK nations, where the target is for patients to start treatment within around nine weeks (officially, 62 days) of an urgent cancer referral. Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, believes that there is a lack of accountability in the English health system specifically, with too many NHS organisations. Addressing this, she says, should improve the quality of cancer care. \"That means clarity over who in the government and NHS is responsible for delivering each part of the plan. \"Ultimately, responsibility for the success or failure of the plan should rest with the health and social care secretary.\" She points out that there are similarities between England and Denmark's state-run health systems - for example, the roughly similar amount they spend on health as a share of national income, meaning Denmark's example could be followed in England. But this would require a long-term plan, political leadership, higher investment, more cancer screening, and stronger targets. Which is no easy feat. Elisabeth Ketelsen, who is 82, is an active person, still swimming in international events - she has broken world records for her age group. But in 2022, she discovered a lump in her breast. \"I saw the doctor on Monday – on the following Thursday I had mammography and a biopsy and from then on it went so quickly my head was spinning, almost.\" Just three weeks after the diagnosis Elisabeth, who is from Denmark, had surgery. Radiotherapy started two weeks later. Last year, the cancer reappeared in her spine and she was immediately prescribed chemotherapy pills and hormone treatment. The cancer stabilised and she has come off chemotherapy. She has since returned to the swimming pool, competing at an event in Singapore. \"The system works,\" she tells me. Not all Danish patients are as complimentary, of course, but Danish health officials say their targets for rapid cancer diagnosis are being met for about 80% of their patients. This all comes down to the idea that Danish authorities are not just trying to treat cancer; they're also keen to improve the experience of patients. Counselling houses, where therapy and companionship are offered to patients, have opened up across the country. These are funded largely by the voluntary sector with a small amount of state funding. (These follow a similar model as the Maggie's cancer support charity in the UK.) Mette Engel, who runs a counselling centre in Copenhagen, tells me mental health is very important in Denmark's cancer plan. \"We see ourselves as a national part of this support system.\" Denmark's move to start treating more cancer patients away from hospitals is also part of this wider shift of Danish healthcare from hospitals into communities. Michael Ziegler, mayor of Høje-Taastrup Municipality near Copenhagen, was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2022. After a stem cell transplant, he was back at work within seven months. Ziegler had chemotherapy in his own home, using what's known as a chemo pump. \"I could have some quality of life, being able to do things at home I wanted to do instead of being stuck in a hospital room,\" he says. \"I also think at hospitals there is always at risk of getting infections. The chemo has the effect of reducing my immune system to a very low level so I am vulnerable to infections.\" There haven't yet been any major studies and so hard data is limited, but it's thought by some that at-home chemo could potentially boost survival chances by lowering the risk of a patient catching an infection while in hospital. His cancer has since returned and he will be restarting treatment, including more chemotherapy and a new stem cell transplant. He says he is \"feeling optimistic\". The Danish health system has certain parallels with the NHS - not least as both are mainly funded by taxpayers. The two nations also face similar challenges when considering the overall health of the population. Alcohol consumption is similar in both nations, though obesity levels in Denmark are lower and smoking rates are higher. (One Danish health leader told me that they were envious of UK initiatives on smoking, with the minimum age for tobacco sales rising each year.) However, there are certain challenges specific to the UK: the population of England, for example, is nearly 10 times larger than Denmark's population. And the NHS is a complex organisation. Still, ministers have made no secret of their interest in the Danish system, with an official visit earlier this year. Wes Streeting, the UK Health Secretary, says: \"Denmark's healthcare system is known the world over for its excellence, having transformed outcomes through its cancer plans, and Health Minister Karin Smyth's trip to the country earlier this year offered us vital insights up close.\" Mr Streeting says these insights have \"fed into\" government health plans to \"speed up cancer diagnoses and deliver cutting edge treatments to the NHS front line quicker\". Michelle Mitchell of Cancer Research UK agrees that Denmark offers a useful template. \"They are diagnosing cancer earlier, people are surviving longer, more people are taking up screening – all of those factors as well as investment in workforce and kit are critical components of a cancer plan.\" She argues that British health ministers could move towards Danish-style national waiting time targets rather than the UK's current system of \"benchmarks\", which are weaker and haven't been met since 2015. The greater challenge for the NHS though, is that there are so many other problems - crowded A&E departments, overstretched staff and, as one analyst put it, \"multiple fires burning\" - meaning that it can be difficult to persuade health leaders to focus on cancer survival. Ruth Thorlby, assistant director of policy at The Health Foundation think tank, says that policymakers in London and Copenhagen both realised at the same time, in the 1990s, that cancer needed urgent attention and urgent plans were drawn up. But whilst Danish policymakers saw policies through, she argues that in the UK the momentum \"dissipated\", as other priorities and short-term problems emerged. \"This is unfinished business - over the last decade there has been a move away from cancer plans,\" she says. At the heart of Denmark's success was a sense of political consensus. From the 1990s onwards, figures from all major parties agreed that cancer should be a priority. This is a level of agreement the UK has not managed to reach, she says. Mr Fisker of the Danish Cancer Society argues that the usual cut-and-thrust of party politics needs to be set aside. \"Politicians must promise each other there is going to be a long, lasting partnership. And health leaders need to operate on a 10-, 15-, 20-year basis,\" he says - longer than the life of any one government or party. But does he think that's possible in the UK? After all, Westminster is not known for much long-term, cross-party thinking. \"If you are really decisive, if you really want to do this and are committed to it over a period of time, and you are also ready to invest then I think it can be done,\" he says. With a pause, he adds: \"Nothing comes without investment.\" BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "text": "Doctors warn hospitals under pressure as NHS waiting lists rise. Doctors say the NHS is struggling to meet demand in England as new data shows the waiting list for routine treatment increasing for the second month in a row. An estimated 7.4m planned procedures were waiting to be carried out in July, up 34,000 on the previous month and the highest level since March. NHS England said many more patients were coming forward for treatment and a doctors' strike in July left 50,000 appointments cancelled. The Royal College of Surgeons said the system was coming under severe strain and called for more money for new operating theatres in the autumn budget. \"Crumbling hospital buildings are leading surgeons to have to compete for space, directly contributing to delays and leaving patients waiting for the care they need,\" said the organisation's vice president Prof Frank Smith. The latest monthly data also showed the number facing very long waits to start routine treatment had increased. There were 1,429 patients waiting more than 18 months in July, up from 1,103 in June, though down sharply compared to last year. Routine treatment includes anything booked in advance, from a consultation with a specialist to minor operations or major surgery. The government has set a target of treating 65% of those patients within 18 weeks by March 2026 and 92% by March 2029. In July just 61.3% of treatments were delivered in that time, down slightly on the previous month but up from 58.8% in 2024. Tim Gardner, assistant director of policy at the Health Foundation, an independent thinktank, said: \"The NHS waiting list often increases at this time of year, but the government is likely to be disappointed not to have made further progress on its commitment to ending hospital backlogs. \"While the NHS was able to maintain a relatively high volume of treatment in July, which included the five-day strike by resident doctors, this is the second consecutive month the waiting list has increased.\" The NHS said that it delivered 3% more planned treatments compared with last year with the number of patients joining the waiting list up by 5%. It also saw its busiest August ever in A&E and for emergency calls to the ambulance service. NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, ambulance services and other trusts, said staff were \"running to stand still\" given the increase in demand, and A&E units were also under \"relentless pressure\". \"If we're going to make a real dent in waiting lists and get more patients seen faster, we need to change how to deliver healthcare,\" said the body's chief executive Daniel Elkeles. \"The shift to seeing patients closer to home and preventing sickness needs to happen quickly.\" NHS England said that progress had been made on cancer care, which is measured separately from the waiting list for routine treatment. The proportion of patients who had waited no longer than 62 days from an urgent suspected cancer referral to their first treatment was 69.2% in July, up from 67.1% in June. The government has set a target date of March 2026 for this figure to hit 75%. It comes as senior cancer doctors have told the BBC that excessive red tape means some patients are struggling to access the very latest treatments like immunotherapy drugs and advanced radiotherapy. The government is due to publish its long-awaited cancer strategy for England by the end of the year. Professor Meghana Pandit, NHS national medical director, said: \"Industrial action in the NHS is never easy for patients, but despite the disruption record number of cancer patients got the care they needed. \"Ambulance response times were the fastest they've been in over four years - even as A&E and ambulance staff saw more patients than ever before.\" The health secretary Wes Streeting said the government had delivered on its promise of delivering two million extra NHS appointments in its first year of power. \"Our 10-year health plan will go even further, driving care out of our busy hospitals and into local communities as we deliver the radical transformation required to fix our broken health service,\" he said. The maternity and paediatric units were closed in May after a watchdog flagged safety concerns. Residents are being asked to increase their awareness in aid of Male Cancer Awareness Week. The NHS vaccination programmes started earlier this month and Wolverhampton resident are urged to get protected. The hospitals in Shrewsbury and Telford will be able to do more teaching and research as a result. The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust says it will need up to 63 extra beds. Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "text": "Postcode lottery for new cancer treatments, doctors warn. Senior cancer doctors are warning that excessive red tape means some patients in England are struggling to access the latest cancer treatments. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) says bureaucracy is \"stifling innovation\" and that applying for funding to pay for new treatments can be \"cumbersome\" for some cancer centres. It says the situation is leading to an unacceptable postcode lottery with some cutting-edge treatments only available in the larger, better-funded units. The government says a new cancer strategy, due later this year, will \"put the NHS back at the forefront of global cancer care\". Doctors and scientists say we are living through a golden age of cancer treatment, with new breakthroughs now changing the way patients are cared for. Survival rates for many common cancers have been rising, partly driven by new technologies such as immunotherapy drugs and more advanced radiotherapy. But the body representing both radiologists, who analyse scans and treat patients, and cancer doctors says that NHS bureaucracy means some are missing out on the latest life-saving treatments. The RCR says that even some well-established advances, such as Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy - or SABR - can still be difficult to access. SABR is a way of more accurately targeting the disease with a precise dose of high-strength radiation, and is typically used to treat very small tumours in the lungs, liver, lymph nodes and brain. The RCR says individual cancer units still have to apply to NHS England to fund its use, leading to a postcode lottery where some patients lose out. \"That is inequitable and unjust and not compatible with the National Health Service,\" says Dr Nicky Thorp, a practising cancer doctor and vice president for clinical oncology at the RCR. \"We would like red tape to be cut and the commissioners to listen to clinicians who really understand the impact on patient care,\" she added. Both the RCR and the Society of Radiographers have written to the government asking for SABR to be made more easily available, along with other cutting-edge treatments such as some immunotherapy medicines and molecular radiotherapy, which uses radioactive drugs to target cancer cells. NHS England says every hospital trust that is delivering radiotherapy is able to offer SABR, and it is committed to a more \"streamlined approach\" to expanding its use. Ray Bowen, 76, from Middlesborough had one of his kidneys removed in 2019 after being diagnosed with cancer. In 2022 a scan showed the disease had returned in his second kidney and he was told surgery would not be possible. \"At best that meant I would have needed to be put on dialysis which I really would not have fancied,\" he said. Instead the former soldier and shipyard worker was given SABR radiotherapy to treat the cancer with high-dose radiation and, three years on, he says he's doing well. \"I just feel very lucky,\" he said. \"Not long ago something like this wouldn't have even existed. \"It's a magic treatment and without doubt it needs to be more available.\" The call by cancer doctors comes as the government prepares to publish its long-awaited cancer strategy for England, now expected later this autumn. The charity Cancer Research UK (CRUK) said it should include a new commitment to diagnose cancers earlier after a new report found that only half of people diagnosed with cancer after an urgent referral are getting the news within the target 28 days. For some cancers, such as bone, bladder, kidney and head and neck, only around a third of people receive a diagnosis within the target time. Between 2021 and 2024, the situation for people being diagnosed with cancer has been getting worse, the charity says. But, in contrast, those who don't have cancer after an urgent referral - which is the large majority of people - are informed more quickly, with 75% told the good news within the target time. \"It's promising that more people are having cancer ruled out on time, helping to put their minds at ease,\" says Cancer Research UK chief executive Michelle Mitchell. \"However it's unacceptable that only half of people who have cancer are being diagnosed within the target timeframe.\" Follow-up tests to confirm the presence of cancer, particularly complex ones, and what type it is can cause delays in diagnosis. This can lead to delays in starting treatment too. Jon Shelton, head of cancer intelligence at CRUK, says this process \"is taking too long\" and tests need to be carried out \"as quickly as possible\". A spokeswoman for NHSE England said the health service is seeing and treating more cancer patients than ever before, while rolling out new initiatives, such as home tests and mobile scanning trucks, to diagnose the disease earlier. The Department of Health described cancer care as an urgent priority and said its upcoming national cancer strategy would give patients \"the most cutting-edge care\". \"Our plan for change is already making an impact, with 148,000 more people having cancer diagnosed or ruled out within 28 days from July 2024 to June 2025 compared to a year earlier,\" a spokesman said. The maternity and paediatric units were closed in May after a watchdog flagged safety concerns. Residents are being asked to increase their awareness in aid of Male Cancer Awareness Week. The NHS vaccination programmes started earlier this month and Wolverhampton resident are urged to get protected. Owen from Ludlow was persuaded to get a lump checked out when he went for a haircut.

    "text": "Fertility clinics must stop unproven treatments, watchdog warns. Both NHS and private fertility clinics must stop offering unproven treatments that don't help people have children, new official guidelines say. The draft guidance advises against several popular fertility \"add-ons\", including so-called endometrial scratches. These add-ons can \"give false hope and put people through unnecessary procedures at an already difficult time\", experts at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) say. They also recommend fertility preservation services such as egg freezing should be more widely available, including to women with severe, recurrent endometriosis. The guideline committee considered a recent survey by the fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which showed almost three-quarters of people who had had fertility treatment between September and October 2024 had said they were using additional tests or emerging technologies, despite most not being proven to work. And only 37% of those questioned said the risks of any add-ons had been explained. The updated draft guidance specifically advises against: The guidance says patients must be given all the information necessary about treatments, including how likely they are to be successful and the risks and benefits involved. Dr Fergus Macbeth, chair of NICE's fertility guideline committee, said clinics should focus on proven treatments rather than offering unproven add-ons that may do more harm than good. \"People going through fertility treatment are often willing to try anything that might help them conceive. \"This makes them vulnerable to being offered treatments that sound promising but haven't been properly tested. Our recommendations are designed to protect patients and ensure they only receive care that we know works,\" he added.  The guidance also looks at fertility preservation services (for example freezing eggs, embryos or sperm) which are currently mostly offered to people with cancer. The updated draft suggests these treatments should also be offered people with medical conditions or undergoing treatment that can impair their fertility. This includes women with severe recurrent endometriosis, people who have had surgery that can affect their reproductive organs and those with genetic or metabolic conditions that may affect their chances of having a baby. People who feel they may benefit should have discuss the options available with healthcare professionals, NICE says. The updated guidelines also consider who should be offered IVF. NICE's committee found stronger evidence than has previously been available that three full cycles of IVF give couples a good chance of a baby, and that the treatment represents good value for the NHS. NICE recommends: While NICE provides recommendations on this, funding decisions are taken locally by organisations called integrated care boards. NICE's chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Benger, said: \"We recognise the NHS faces significant financial challenges and integrated care boards must weigh up local priorities when determining how many IVF cycles to fund.\" The draft guidelines for England, Wales and Northern Ireland are open for public consultation until Tuesday 21 October and the final recommendations will be published in 2026.

    "text": "Rise in number of people facing hunger  in the UK. A third of children under five are living in UK homes where there is not enough access to healthy and nutritious food, according to anti-poverty charity Trussell Trust. Surveys by the charity found more than 14 million people in the UK faced the prospect of going hungry last year due to lack of money. This marks an increase from the trust's last survey in 2022 when that number was 11.6 million people. The government said it is \"determined to tackle the unacceptable rise in food bank dependence\". The survey was conducted in two parts, the first by Ipsos (a market research organisation) on behalf of the charity, which sent questionnaires to 4,427 random adults. A second survey was also conducted by Ipsos, this time with 3,866 adults who had been referred to food banks. There were also interviews with people who had and hadn't visited food banks but were identified as facing \"food insecurity\". Food insecurity is defined by the Evidence and Network on UK Household Food insecurity (ENUF) as the lack of money to ensure reliable and constant access to food that meets dietary and nutritional needs. ENUF says it can be \"acute, transitory, or chronic\", and ranges in severity from \"worry about not being able to secure enough food to going whole days without eating\". Figures suggest one in four children in the UK live in what the charity refers to as food insecure households. Helen Barnard, at Trussell Trust, said she had been told parents were \"losing sleep, worrying about how they will pay for new shoes, school trips, keep the lights on or afford the bus fare to work\". She added: \"We have already created a generation of children who've never known life without food banks. That must change\". Ms Barnard called on the government to address the results of the survey, referencing Prime Minister Keir Starmer's manifesto pledge to tackle poverty and end the need for food banks. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson told the BBC: \"In addition to extending free school meals and ensuring the poorest children don't go hungry in the holidays with £1billion to reform crisis support, our child poverty taskforce will publish an ambitious strategy later this year. \"We are also overhauling job centres and reforming the broken welfare system to support people into good, secure jobs, while always protecting those who need it most.\" Other findings from the survey include an increase in the number of people accessing food banks from working households - up from a quarter of households in 2022 to a third in 2024. Those in manual and service jobs were the worst affected, with care workers and bus drivers highlighted as some of the working people most at risk of going hungry. Trussell Trust said low incomes were the main cause of hungry households in the UK. The survey of people referred to food banks revealed that households that accessed them would be left with an average of £104 a week to pay for food, bills, work or school travel and essential toiletries. This worked out at 17% of what the average UK household would have left after rent or mortgage payments. More than 1,000 students will be given a £50 uniform voucher, Hull City Council said. Morgan Betchley was \"brutalised\" by Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, her mother-in-law says. Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out her economic plans in her second Budget on 26 November.

    "text": "Alzheimer's blood test could 'revolutionise' diagnosis. More than 1,000 people across the UK with suspected dementia are to be offered a blood test for Alzheimer's disease which it is hoped could revolutionise diagnosis of the disease. The blood test can detect biomarkers for rogue proteins which accumulate in the brains of patients with the condition and will be used in addition to pen and paper cognitive tests, which often misdiagnose it in its early stages. Scientists leading the trial at University College London believe the blood test will improve the accuracy of diagnosis from 70% to more than 90% and want to see how that helps patients and clinicians. Patients will be recruited at 20 memory clinics as part of the study, which aims to see how well the test works within the NHS. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and is associated with the build-up in the brain of two rogue proteins - amyloid and tau - which can accumulate for up to 20 years before symptoms emerge. The new blood test, which costs around £100, measures a biomarker called p-tau217, which reflects the presence of both proteins. Previously, the only way to confirm Alzheimer's was by specialist PET brain scans and lumbar punctures to extract cerebrospinal fluid. However, these \"gold standard\" tests are not part of routine Alzheimer's diagnosis and only 2% of patients ever receive them. Professor Fiona Carragher, chief policy and research officer at the Alzheimer's Society, said: \"Our recent Lived Experience Survey revealed that only a third of people with dementia felt their experience of the diagnosis process was positive, while many reported being afraid of receiving a diagnosis. \"As a result, too often, dementia is diagnosed late, limiting access to support, treatment and opportunities to plan ahead.\" Now, the Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis and Plasma p-tau217 (ADAPT) trial has begun recruitment at a memory clinic in Essex, with 19 additional specialist NHS centres planned to be involved across the UK. The study is being led by scientists at University College London, and is supported by Alzheimer's Research UK, the Alzheimer's Society, with funding from the People's Postcode Lottery. Jonathan Schott, professor of neurology at University College London and chief medical officer at Alzheimer's Research UK said he was \"thrilled\" to welcome participants onto the ADAPT trial. He described the trial as \"a critical part of the Blood Biomarker Challenge, which we hope will take us a step forward in revolutionising the way we diagnose dementia.\" Half the participants in the study will receive their blood tests results within three months while the others will be told after 12 months. The study team will establish whether providing results earlier helps speed up diagnosis, guides decisions about further investigations, and influences how both patients and doctors interpret and respond to the results. The impact of blood test results on quality of life will also be measured. If the trial is deemed successful, the blood test could become a standard part of Alzheimer's diagnosis. This will be crucial in years to come as a raft of new drugs to combat early-stage disease are in the final stages of clinical trials. Steven Pidwill, 71, from north London, says an accurate, rapid blood test for Alzheimer's, combined with new treatments, would be a \"gamechanger\" for families affected by the condition. His partner of more than 50 years, Rachel Hawley, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease almost a decade ago. Steven told the BBC: \"I think it would mean everybody's idea of Alzheimer's would change. We would treat Alzheimer's more like having a disability, rather than sort of a curse, and something we can't talk about.\" A diagnosis of Alzheimer's can be devastating but the couple say they refuse to let the disease spoil their time together. Rachel, 72, said: \"I think I still have a very happy life, and am very lucky in all sorts of ways.\" The couple were part of a group of patients with lived experience of Alzheimer's, who helped researchers at UCL design the trial and the feedback to potential volunteers. The team at UCL expect to have results in around three years. The simulation suits are helping health staff understand the frustration patients face every day.

    "text": "Best and worst-performing NHS Trusts in England named. New league tables rating the performance of NHS trusts in England have been published for the first time, with specialist hospitals taking the top slots. Number one is Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, followed by the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust and cancer centre the Christie NHS Foundation Trust. At the bottom is Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn, which has had major problems with its buildings because of structural weaknesses and the need for props to hold up ceilings. Health Secretary Wes Streeting defended the tables as a tool for helping to inform the public and let them exercise choice, while trusts questioned their usability and the metrics employed. Trusts in England will be ranked every three months - with the top performers given more power over how they spend their money and those lower down encouraged to learn from the best trusts and receive support from national officials. The rankings score NHS trusts on seven different areas including waiting times for operations, cancer treatment, time spent in A&E and ambulance response times. Performance levels are calculated based on data submitted by the trusts. Their finances are also assessed, and it is possible that a hospital rated highly for clinical care will be marked down if they are running up a larger than expected deficit. The trusts are then sorted into four categories called segments, with the best overall performers in segment one and the worst in segment four. Trusts experiencing financial difficulties cannot be ranked higher than segment three, even if they are assessed to have a good standard of care. Within each segment, the trusts are ranked by their average metric scores, and the lower each score, the better the ranking. The public will be able to use the league tables to check the performance of their local hospital, ambulance service or mental health trust. Moorfields in London tops the list of trusts with an overall score of 1.39, while the Queen Elizabeth Hospital comes bottom with 3.35. A spokesperson for the Queen Elizabeth Hospital said: \"Our patients deserve the highest standards of care, and we are sorry that in some of our performance areas... we have fallen short. Immediate steps are being taken to address the issues.\" The Countess of Chester hospital, in north-west England, came second to last. The hospital had its emergency services department rated inadequate by the Care Quality Commission last month. Streeting accused health think tanks of \"elitist nonsense\" after claims that the new league tables in England would be difficult to interpret. Another criticism has been that managers will try to game the system to improve rankings, for example on financial performance, which will skew the tables. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Streeting said: \"Basically what a bunch of very well-informed researchers are saying is they can have access to all the data points, they know what's going on, they're qualified to make judgements about these data points, but Joe Public aren't. \"I'm sorry, that is elitist nonsense. I want patients to know, and staff to know, what is actually going on in terms of the performance of the trust that serves them or the trust that they work in.\" Saray Woolnough, chief executive of the Kings Fund, denied there was elitism. \"These league tables don't tell you in simple terms if a hospital is performing well or badly,\" she argued. \"We are all for more information in the public domain to help people understand how the health service is performing and to make choices about where they receive treatment. \"But it's not elitist to say these rankings risk confusing people, rather than helping them choose where to get great care.\" NHS Providers, which represents trusts, said there were questions over whether the league tables were accurately identifying the best performing organisations. Chief executive Daniel Elkeles said: \"For league tables to really drive up standards, tackle variations in care, and boost transparency, they need to measure the right things, be based on accurate, clear and objective data and avoid measuring what isn't in individual providers' gift to improve.\" He added that anything less could have unintended consequences that might affect patients' confidence in their local health services. Thea Stein, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said it was understandable that the government was focussed on winning back public trust but there was a risk that trusts would focus only on the measures that immediately boost their ranking, even if it's not necessarily best for patients\". \"As finances have a particular sway on the rankings, this is of limited use for patients trying to choose the best hospital for their care,\" she added. June Kelly, 63, a retired NHS midwife who used to work for North Staffordshire NHS trust in Stoke, got in touch via Your Voice, Your BBC News, to say the new rankings were \"not fair or comprehensive\" and felt \"demoralising for staff\". \"Specialist hospitals at the top of the list is not surprising at all,\" she said. \"They only have limited conditions and diagnosis to deal with. You are not comparing like for like. \"There are so many issues to take into account: size of hospital, demographics, population, wealth, degree of poverty, drug issues, non-English speaking patients, staffing levels. \"It is so much harder to provide excellence for a general hospital who take all and every emergency than for a hospital that concentrates on one specialty with controlled admissions.\" Chris McCann from Healthwatch England said any league table must inform instead of confuse people. \"It will be essential that the new dashboard clearly communicates the information that is most important to patients and that it is as accessible as possible,\" he said. The Department of Health said that from next year the best performing trusts would have more freedom to develop services around local needs while those underperforming would receive \"enhanced support\" but their bosses could also have pay reduced. The highest rated leaders would be offered bigger pay packets in exchange for attempting to turn around struggling trusts. From next summer, the tables would be expanded to cover integrated care boards, which are responsible for planning health services at a local level. Streeting singled out for praise Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, which was the highest ranking non-specialist NHS trust and ninth overall. He said the trust had been able to integrate its A&E response with community services so people could receive care at home, keeping appointments free for planned operations and procedures.   Additional reporting by Rozina Sini, BBC News The maternity and paediatric units were closed in May after a watchdog flagged safety concerns. Residents are being asked to increase their awareness in aid of Male Cancer Awareness Week. The NHS vaccination programmes started earlier this month and Wolverhampton resident are urged to get protected.

    "text": "Deodorant firm sorry after 'itchy, burning armpits' claims. A well-known deodorant brand has apologised after some of its roll-on products reportedly left customers with itchy, burning armpits. Consumers of Mitchum's 48-hour roll-on anti-perspirant and deodorant complained on social media of having \"agonising weeping spots\", redness and irritation after using the product. Posting on TikTok, one customer claimed she wanted to \"rip my armpits out\", while another said her underarms felt like they were \"on fire\". The company said it was \"truly sorry\" and explained how a change in the manufacturing process had affected 100ml batches sold in the UK, Ireland and South Africa. It said it was removing the affected products from shelves. Steph Buttery, 34, from Manchester, has been a loyal Mitchum customer for the last 15 years. But after she started using a new bottle of the firm's aerosol Powder Fresh deodorant in July, she developed an itchy red rash around her armpits and says she \"started smelling really bad\". Steph, who runs a soft drinks company, says she had to keep her arms down throughout an important business meeting, because she was so conscious of the smell. She has since switched deodorant brands and says the problems have stopped. \"I've been totally turned off [Mitchum] for life. I'm going to go for natural deodorant from now on.\" Mitchum has not included any aerosol deodorants in the list of affected products. Steph is one of hundreds of people who have taken to sharing videos of their experience on TikTok. One woman said she was unable to sleep after using the roll-on because it left her with \"second degree chemical burns on my armpits\". Another described her underarm skin as developing a pink rash which had \"scabbed over\". A third said she was left in agony because of \"weeping spots\" under her arm. \"I won't be using any Mitchum products again because I'm not risking this happening again,\" she said. A Mitchum spokesperson said the brand was \"truly sorry some of our customers have experienced temporary irritation\". In a statement, the company said: \"We want to reassure there has been no change to the formula of our products, but we have identified a change in the manufacturing process affecting one of our raw materials. \"This has impacted how the roll-on interacts with the skin of some users.\" It did not give details of what the change to its manufacturing process was but said the issue had since been resolved and it was working to \"remove the small amount of product\" left in shops. \"In addition, we have reverted to the original manufacturing process to ensure no other batches are affected,\" the spokesperson said. Mitchum advised all those affected to contact its customer services team so it could \"make this right\". The firm has issued a list of all the affected 100ml roll-on products. These are: Morgan Betchley was \"brutalised\" by Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, her mother-in-law says.

    "text": "Error leaves 55,000 diabetes patients needing new tests. Errors by machines used to diagnose diabetes mean at least 55,000 people in England will need further blood tests, a BBC investigation has discovered. Some patients have been wrongly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and even prescribed medication they don't need - and there could be more people affected, say NHS England. NHSE has confirmed 16 hospital trusts use the machines, made by Trinity Biotech, which have produced inaccurate test results. In a statement, Trinity Biotech says it is working closely with the UK health regulator and has contacted all hospitals which use the machines.  The BBC first reported in September 2024 that 11,000 patients faced re-testing after a machine at Luton and Dunstable Hospital issued incorrect diabetes results. NHS England now say type 2 diabetes diagnoses rose by 10,000 in 2024, 4% more than expected. The procedure, known as the haemoglobin A1C test, measures average blood sugar levels which are used to diagnose type 2 diabetes and monitor the condition. According to the medicines and healthcare regulator (MHRA), issues with the tests on these machines was first reported in April 2024. The BBC has asked NHS England to confirm which trusts are affected. Vicky Davies, 36, from Kingston upon Hull was first told she had type 2 diabetes in October 2024. She was advised to try and lose weight first, sent for eye screening and was later prescribed what she understands was the maximum dose of the diabetes drug metformin. In April 2025 she had further blood tests as part of her three month review and was told that she wasn't diabetic, which she assumed was because she had been on metformin. Later that month though, she was told her blood results might not have been accurate and advised to come off the medication immediately. During the four months she took metformin she suffered with stomach issues and dizziness and still feels stressed. \"It's had a huge effect on my life. Since the diagnosis I have suffered with stress and had to take time off work to attend appointments. \"I've complained to my GP, but I didn't really get an apology. I'm just so angry,\" she told BBC News. In a letter, Vicky's GP practice told her they were not aware of the problems occurring in the laboratories, adding that they work to the best of their ability with the medical information available. The NHS trust which runs diabetes tests for Hull says it has stopped using the kit in question, \"We understand this situation may have caused concern and apologise for any worry or anxiety,\" said a spokesperson for York and Scarborough Teaching Hospitals  NHS Foundation Trust.  In September 2024, a message on the Bedfordshire trust website said 11,000 patients needed to be re-tested. It warned some of them could have been misdiagnosed with type 2 diabetes as a result of problems with tests analysed at the hospital's laboratory. The trust apologised \"for any emotional distress and inconvenience\". In July 2025, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said it had received reports describing a positive bias delivered by the Trinity Biotech machines. This resulted in some patients being incorrectly diagnosed as pre-diabetic or diabetic. NHS trusts are already recalling patients for repeat tests and NHS England says anyone who needs a repeat test will be contacted by their GP or local hospital. It adds that, for people who may have been wrongly diagnosed as a result of this issue, the risk is low and they would be given lifestyle advice and offered support programmes first. Metformin, which may have been mistakenly prescribed for some of these patients, works by lowering blood sugar levels by improving the way the body handles insulin. If you experience these symptoms whilst taking diabetes medication: The advice is to seek medical attention immediately. Prof Kamila Hawthorne, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said that while \"errors can and do happen...  the prospect of widespread technology failures like this will be of huge concern for all GPs, primarily because of the unnecessary distress, inconvenience and anxiety they can cause our patients.\" Prof Hawthorne said the priority was to minimise the impact on patients but there would also be a significant impact on GPs' workload and they would need support. Dr Clare Hambling, diabetes national clinical director for NHS England, said potential misdiagnosis of a long-term condition like type 2 diabetes \"is understandably worrying, however the clinical risk of harm to patients following this issue is low\". NHS England says fewer than 10% of their laboratories were affected and all have either replaced the machines or addressed calibration issues. In response to an inquiry from the BBC, Trinity Biotech said: \"The company has worked closely with the MHRA to resolve the issues experienced by some UK labs using the system.\" The statement also said the company had \"issued three Field Safety Notices in 2024 to all UK users, informing them of a potential positive bias issue.\" These notices included \"reiteration of details of the actions to be taken to ensure optimum operation of the system, with an emphasis on the importance of operating the system per the manufacturer's instructions,\" the statement continued.   Some patients may be need to retested for type 2 diabetes because of an inaccurate machine. Chris Bright says it \"surreal\" to see his bill debated at the House of Commons.

    "text": "Disabled NHS medic told she's 'not a real doctor'. A disabled doctor, who believes the NHS sees it as \"too difficult or inconvenient\" to give her support, says she has considered leaving the profession. Dr Alice Gatenby said senior colleagues told her she was \"not a real doctor\" because her epilepsy means she does not work night shifts. A survey by the British Medical Association (BMA) of more than 800 disabled and neurodivergent doctors and medical students found more than half felt ableism was a bigger issue in the medical profession than in wider society. The Welsh government said it expected all NHS organisations to support inclusion, and they were also legally required to support disabled staff through reasonable adjustments. Health boards in Wales are responsible for rotas, but NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership said as an inclusive employer it supports employers and resident doctors with adjustments needed. However, south Wales-based Dr Gatenby said: \"The irony of a healthcare system being unwilling to make small adjustments for someone with epilepsy isn't lost on me. \"It feels like the system sees supporting me as too difficult or inconvenient, even if it means losing someone capable and passionate about caring for patients.\" Dr Liz Murray spent more than a decade working in the NHS, simultaneously managing a number of chronic conditions, but left two years ago because of the barriers she felt were put in place. The Norfolk-based doctor has lupus, severe endometriosis, bladder and bowel damage as well as hip problems, which mean she uses mobility aids. But her requests for part-time hours and no night shifts were declined. \"I have a slightly dysfunctional immune system and am really susceptible to infections with big changes in life, or disruption to sleep and environmental stresses,\" said the 37-year-old. \"They can cause joint flare ups where I can't walk or can't use my hands, and it affects my vision.\" She said for a long time she felt her health conditions were to blame for leaving the profession, but now feels it was the inflexibilities within the system. Despite doctor shortages in her region, she felt she had to leave a role with sick pay and maternity benefits, and opt for locum work because it provided greater flexibility. She added: \"I was seen as the problem - I realised how much of a toll it was taking on my health and had to say enough is enough.\" While still working full-time, she now does so in a way that suits her needs. Dr Murray also set up charity Mortal and Strong, to better support those with life-changing, chronic conditions. The BMA's survey found 53% of respondents had either left the profession in the past two years, or had seriously considered it. Over a third had reported bullying or harassment linked to their disability, neurodivergence or long-term health condition. However, 40% said that telling their place of work or study had led to improved support. Tricia Roberts is a clinical nurse specialist within adult ADHD services at Hywel Dda health board, in west Wales. She was diagnosed with ADHD aged 42, and autism at 47. \"I've been privileged to work in positions where the service gets it,\" said the 49-year-old. \"I'm allowed to have flexible working and feel I can be myself.\" However, she added if funding was available, additional admin support would allow her \"to thrive\". She explained a staff network for neurodivergent colleagues across the health board was \"really empowering\" as people felt supported. Dr Gatenby added: \"If I were a teacher, I wouldn't need to go through a lengthy process to prove I'm disabled every time I changed classrooms. \"But as a doctor with an invisible disability, I must prove to a disability panel that I'm still disabled every single year.\" She is genuinely considering leaving medicine, but said: \"I don't want to, but what choice do I have? \"And yet, I think 'if I walk away, who will be left to advocate for other doctors like me?'\" Dr Gatenby described how senior colleagues said \"you're not a real doctor\" because she cannot do on-call shifts. \"Yet when I ask to be included in weekend rotas, I'm told it's too much hassle unless I can manage 12-hour shifts straight,\" she added. The BMA is trying to address the issues raised in the survey, as nearly three quarters had not received all of the reasonable adjustments they required. Chairman of the BMA's Representative Body Dr Amit Kochhar said: \"Disabled doctors and medical students are present at every level of the profession, contributing as valued and vital members of the medical workforce. \"Providing appropriate support is not only the right thing to do, it's essential. \"A lack of disability and neurodiversity awareness, coupled with discrimination and stigma, can significantly impact disabled doctors' lives and careers.\" He added those who had already overcome personal hurdles should not face additional barriers, such as rigid exam policies or being unfairly penalised throughout their careers. Leandra Craine, from Disability Wales, responded to the survey by saying: \"Not only is this concerning for the healthcare sector itself but raises a significant issue when it comes to accounting for and treating disabled people. \"Without the inclusion and representation of disabled people in all areas of life, society-wide empathy and accessibility will never be achieved.\" NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership said: \"As an inclusive employer, we support resident doctors with any adjustments they need. \"We securely record and share these adjustments with the health boards where they are based to implement. \"We can work with health boards to support them in this as needed. \"As health boards are responsible for the rota management we actively work with them to review reasonable adjustments - including shift patterns and night working.\" The Welsh government added: \"We expect all NHS Wales organisations to actively promote inclusion and they are legally required to support disabled staff through reasonable adjustments and anti-discrimination measures under the Equality Act.\" Michael Hodgson has agreed to pay money to a local church as a part of an out-of-court solution.

    "text": "'My son's constipation wasn't taken seriously until he reached crisis point'. A mother who feared her two-year-old son's untreated constipation could have killed him is calling for access to children's continence services to be made a national priority. Elissa Novak said Ivan was constantly vomiting, losing weight and in severe pain when it was at its worst, and a doctor said 2kg of his 10kg (22lb) body weight was estimated to be stool. The number of children aged up to 16 admitted to English hospitals suffering with constipation, among other symptoms, is at a 10-year high, with more than 44,000 admissions in 2023-24, according to NHS figures. Children are being failed by the absence of dedicated bladder and bowel services in some parts of the country, an expert said. About 1.5 million children in the UK suffer with constipation, according to the charity Bladder and Bowel UK. As many children returned to school this week, charities have told the BBC they are seeing a spike in calls to their helplines. \"It's a huge problem and many healthcare professionals don't consider it a serious issue in children,\" said Davina Richardson, a children's specialist nurse with the charity. \"Discussing wee and poo is very un-British. It's not something that we as a culture do.\" Elissa said Ivan, who is now aged five, had been \"completely robbed of his toddler years\" due to health issues resulting from constipation. He was admitted to hospital 25 times in one six-month period in 2022 for emergency treatment. \"It was horrific,\" Elissa said. \"He was so frail he couldn't lift himself up or do anything. \"He was in pain all the time and either screaming or just lying there because he was too weak.\" Elissa, 35, from Nuneaton, said she had constantly gone to hospital paediatricians to try to get help and answers. At that time in Warwickshire, there was no bowel or bladder community service, which meant they were going to A&E up to four times a week. It was only when things got to a crisis point that Elissa was told constipation was causing Ivan's pain. She thinks he would have died had there been any further delay in treating it. Elissa was told Ivan's entire colon was impacted, which had pushed up into his lung cavity and compromised his lungs. \"His stomach was squashed. All of his organs were being pushed out of the way,\" Elissa said. \"We were in A&E for up to 12 hours at a time... just waiting for an enema of all things. \"It was a very horrible time. It was so traumatic for everybody.\" Ivan has two genetic syndromes which affect his cognitive functions. Elissa thinks this played a part in the signs being missed and constipation not being diagnosed sooner. \"It was seen as 'that's just what disabled children are like'. We did actually have one consultant who said 'disabled children just scream',\" Elissa said. \"It wasn't looked into properly, it wasn't taken seriously until he was really at crisis point. His signs of pain weren't recognised. It was just a perfect storm really.\" Ivan now has a care package so his constipation can be managed at home with laxatives and daily bowel wash outs. \"It is a huge part of his life and a huge part of his day. He still suffers pain but it's so much better,\" his mother said. Elissa is campaigning for better bladder and bowel care services across the country. \"People are falling through the cracks,\" she said. Here are some of the ways to prevent a child from becoming constipated: Source: Bladder and Bowel UK Brenda Cheer, a paediatric specialist continence nurse with children's bowel and bladder charity Eric, said children's constipation was on the rise for a number of reasons, including delayed potty training and today's generation of children spending more time in childcare. She said children were being failed in areas where there was no dedicated children's continence service. \"There's huge disparity of those services,\" she said. \"Where is the parent supposed to go? How are they supposed to get the help they need? How is a family supposed to access support if there is no children's bladder and bowel nurse?\" Constipation can be treated in the community and should not require a hospital admission, but is not being recognised, Ms Cheer added. Holly Brennan told the BBC her daughter Ayda had suffered with chronic constipation for three years and she had been in \"turmoil\" at the lack of help. It started when Ayda got a virus when she was two years old and spiralled from there, Holly said. The 31-year-old described going to her GP six times and being prescribed laxatives to treat it - but not being given any guidance on how to use them, and said she had been told her daughter would grow out of it. When it was at its worst, Ayda, now five, would have up to 15 accidents a day. Holly, from Clevedon, Bristol, said: \"It was three years of hell. She very much didn't grow out of it. \"We didn't want to go out for day trips because you wouldn't know where the toilet would be and she was constantly having accidents. \"It was just complete stress and caused arguments between my husband and I [about] how to deal with it. It upset her [Ayda] and you try not to get cross with them but it's just frustration and it just affects everything.\" Sometimes it would take Ayda a week to go to the toilet because she associated it with pain, her mum explained. \"It was a vicious circle. It was just complete turmoil... something that everyone just used to say she would grow out of or 'it's a phase' or 'she just needs to learn',\" Holly added. \"Our life literally revolved around the toilet for three years.\" Holly was not referred for further treatment for Ayda or told about children's continence services that could help. She said it felt like \"the blind leading the blind\" with several doctors unable to advise her and she had reached a dead end. It was only when she was told about the charity Eric that things started to get better. \"There was finally an answer on how to help her,\" Holly added. \"It [the website] described my child.\" Ayda is now off laxatives and able to control her bowels. \"I'm very proud of her and how she's coped. She's taken it all in her stride,\" Holly said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it is committed to ensuring children get the right care and support when they need it for conditions such as constipation. In a statement, it said: \"As part of our 10-year health plan, neighbourhood health services will bring together teams of professionals closer to people's home to provide comprehensive community care. \"We will also strengthen health visiting services so all families have access to high-quality, personalised support.\" Jodie Gosling, MP for Nuneaton and who chairs the all-party parliamentary group for bladder and bowel continence care, said constipation had fallen low on the list of priorities facing local council and integrated care boards. She said children's continence care \"has been a silent casualty of chronic underfunding and reactive healthcare\". \"This leads to a postcode lottery, where even high-need areas fail to address issues like constipation adequately.\" Follow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

The government is planning a new law in England to stop anyone under the age of 16 buying energy drinks such as Red Bull, Monster and Prime from shops, restaurants, cafes, vending machines and online. Up to a third of UK children are thought to consume these types of drinks every week, despite most supermarkets having already introduced a voluntary ban. Some popular drinks contain more caffeine than two cups of coffee. Excessive consumption is linked to headaches and sleep problems. Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government had \"been called upon\" to act by parents, teachers and children. \"You can see the impact on the health, concentration and the learning, and that is why we are acting,\" he told BBC Breakfast. Too much caffeine can cause a rapid heart rate, abnormal heart rhythms and seizures. Although rare, there have been some deaths linked to excess caffeine. The sugary versions of the drinks can also cause damage to teeth and contribute to obesity, according to The Association of UK Dieticians. A consultation will now run for 12 weeks to gather evidence from health and education experts as well as the public and retailers and manufacturers who already ban the drinks. While no official date has been set for the ban, Streeting said it will come in \"a lot sooner\" than the end of this parliament - the deadline Labour had previously promised. Carrera, 18, is part of a youth activist group called Bite Back. She told Today that manufacturers are \"clever\" by working with influencers, using fun packaging and creating enticing flavours aimed at young people. \"It's no wonder energy drinks have become the social currency of the playground,\" she added. Responding on the programme, Streeting said the government needs to \"change with the times\" and tackle social media advertising. Lower-caffeine soft drinks, such Diet Coke, are not affected by the ban, and neither are tea and coffee. TV chef Jamie Oliver has repeatedly warned of the dangers and disruption energy drinks can cause, with kids coming into school \"bouncing off the walls\" having had energy drinks for breakfast. \"We are talking about three, four shots of espresso in one of these things. Loads of sugar. So an absolute nightmare,\" he said in a video posted on X last year. Under current labelling rules, any drink, other than tea or coffee, with over 150mg of caffeine per litre requires a warning label saying: \"High caffeine content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breast-feeding women.\" Young people have smaller bodies and their brains are still developing, which can make them more sensitive to caffeine, say experts. For most adults, up to 400mg of caffeine a day, or about four cups of instant coffee or five cups of tea, is safe. The previous Conservative government had planned to introduced the ban, but scrapped the move in 2022, and said consumption should be a personal choice. Streeting told BBC Breakfast the Tories \"called it wrong\" and while personal responsibility applies for adults, children need a different approach. He explained that from his office he sees kids leaving school popping into the shop and buying drinks on their breaks and on the way home, with nobody to stop them. Prof Steve Turner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said a ban was the \"next logical step\" in making children's diets more healthy. And Prof Amelia Lake from Teesside University, who has studied the drinks' impact on young people's lives, said they had \"no place\" in the diets of children. \"Our research has shown the significant mental and physical health consequences of children drinking energy drinks. \"We know these drinks are part of youth culture and associated with sports, gaming, music and more, but there is a lack of clear signalling about their health consequences.\" But Gavin Partington from the British Soft Drinks Association said manufacturers had already led the way with self regulation. \"As with all government policy, it's essential that any forthcoming regulation is based on a rigorous assessment of the evidence that's available,\" he added. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are also considering a ban. The Health Improvement Commission says it would support a ban on energy drinks for under 16s. Mitchell Allsopp from the Grove School says the drinks have a 'noticeable effect' on students. Some social media influencers are pushing products to young gym-goers and students, health experts warn. The warnings impact certain varieties of High Noon vodka seltzers and Celsius energy drink cans. Paediatricians studied 21 children in the UK and Ireland who became very ill after the icy drinks.

    "text": "Organ transplants for immortality: Might Xi and Putin be onto something?. Is it possible to become immortal with the help of organ transplants? That was the unexpected topic of discussion this week between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin when they met at a military parade in Beijing. A translator, speaking in Mandarin on behalf of Putin, told Xi how human organs can be repeatedly transplanted \"so that one can get younger and younger\" in spite of age, and might even be able to stave off old age \"indefinitely\". \"It's predicted that in this century it might become possible to live to 150,\" he added. Their smiles and laughter suggest it was a bit of banter, but might they be on to something? Organ transplants certainly save lives - in the UK, over 100,000 people have been saved in the last 30 years, says NHS Blood and Transplant. And continued advancements in medicine and technology mean transplanted organs are lasting far longer once in people. Some patients have had a kidney transplant that has kept working for more than 50 years. The lifespan of an organ depends on how healthy the donor and recipient is - plus how well they look after it. For example, if you were to have a new kidney from a living donor, you might expect it to last 20 to 25 years. If you get it from a deceased donor, that drops to 15 to 20 years. The type of organ matters too. A liver might last around 20 years, a heart 15 years and lungs nearly 10 years, according to research. Putin and Xi may be talking about having multiple organs transplanted and perhaps repeatedly. Having surgery is a big undertaking, though, with significant risks. Each time you go under the knife you are rolling the dice. Currently, people who get a new organ also have to take strong anti-rejection drugs  called immunosuppressants for life. These can have side-effects, such as high blood pressure, and increase the risk of infections. Rejection - when your immune system starts to attack the transplanted organ because it recognises it as coming from a different person - can sometimes still happen even if you are taking your medication. Scientists are working on making rejection-free organs, using genetically-altered pigs as the donors. They use a gene editing tool known as crispr to remove some of the pig genes and add certain human genes to make the organ more compatible. Breeding special pigs for this is ideal, say experts, since their organs are roughly the right size for people. The science is still extremely experimental, but a heart and a kidney operation have gone ahead. The two men who agreed to having the procedures were pioneers of this new field of transplantation medicine. Both have since died but helped advance xenotransplantation - the transplanting of living cells, tissues or organs from one species to another. Another avenue being explored is growing brand new organs using our own human cells. Stem cells have the ability to grow into any type of cell or tissue found in the body. No research group has yet been able to make fully functional, transplantable human organs, but scientists are getting closer. In December 2020, UK researchers UCL and the Francis Crick Institute rebuilt a human thymus - an essential organ in the immune system - using human stem cells and a bioengineered scaffold. When transplanted into mice as a test, it appeared to work. And scientists at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London say they have grown human intestinal grafts using stem cells from patient tissue that could one day lead to personalised transplants for children with intestinal failure. But these advances are for treating ill health, rather than keeping people alive to 150. Tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson, meanwhile, is spending millions a year trying to reduce his biological age. He's not tried getting new organs yet - as far as we know - but has infused himself with his 17-year-old son's plasma. He's since stopped that, after seeing no benefits and increased medical scrutiny from organisations such as the Food and Drug Administration. Dr Julian Mutz from King's College London said beyond organ transplantation, approaches like plasma replacement are being explored, but these remain experimental. \"Whether such strategies will have a meaningful impact on lifespan, particularly maximum human lifespan, remains uncertain, though it is an area of considerable scientific interest.\" Prof Neil Mabbott, an expert in immunopathology at the Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, speculates that living to 125 years old might be the upper limit. \"The verified oldest living person was a Frenchwoman, Jeanne Calment who lived for 122 years, between 1875 and1997, \" he told BBC News. And while damaged and diseased organs may be replaceable by transplants, as we age our bodies become much less resilient or able to cope with physical stressors. \"We begin to respond less effectively to infections, and our bodies become more frail, prone to injury and are less able to recover and repair. \"The stress, trauma and impact of transplant surgery, alongside the continued use of immunosuppressive drugs required to prevent rejection of the transplanted organs would be too severe in patients of such advanced age.\" He says rather than focussing on extending life-span, we should instead strive for healthy years lived. Prof Mabbott said: \"Living a lot longer, but suffering from the multiple morbidities that can accompany ageing, and in-and-out of hospital for another tissue transplant does not sound an attractive way to spend my retirement!\" Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "text": "Adults with learning disabilities die 20 years early, report finds. People with learning disabilities and autism in England are dying almost 20 years younger than the rest of the population, a long-awaited report has said. The annual mortality review commissioned by NHS England was originally meant to be published last year but faced repeated delays. It found 39% of deaths of people with learning disabilities and autism were classed as avoidable in 2023, almost twice as high as the general population. NHS England said it was rolling out more training for staff and identifying patients with learning disabilities earlier so they can be given more appropriate care. The charity Mencap says about 1.5 million people in the UK have a learning disability which it defines as a lifelong reduced intellectual ability, usually identified soon after birth or in the early years. The Learning Disabilities Mortality Review (LeDeR) was created in 2015 to try to understand why so many in that group were dying younger than the wider population and from avoidable causes. The latest research, led by a team at King's College London, looked at data from the deaths of 3,556 adults in 2023 and compared it to previous years. It found that while there had been some improvements, with life expectancy  increasing slightly to 62.5 years old, those with learning disabilities and autism were still experiencing significant inequalities. \"These stark new figures show people with a learning disability are dying a shocking 19.5 years younger than the general population,\" said Mencap's chief executive Jon Sparkes. \"People with a learning disability and their families deserve better. In this day and age, no one should die early because they don't get the right treatment.\" In 2023 the most common causes of avoidable death in people with learning disabilities were influenza, pneumonia, cancers of the digestive tract and heart disease. David Lodge, 40, lived with multiple learning disabilities including autism, dyspraxia and dysarthria, which prevented him speaking. In January 2022 he was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary after he was found severely dehydrated on the floor next to the body of his father Peter who had collapsed and died unexpectedly. His sister Dr Keri Lodge, a consultant psychiatrist, said there was an \"overwhelming lack of urgency\" when her brother arrived at hospital. \"Any other 40-year-old man who had not drunk or eaten anything for days would be treated very quickly but with David there was none of that,\" she said. \"There was just this sense of: 'We will put you in this side room and keep you away.'\" A later inquest heard there were multiple failings in David's care. He was not offered pain relief, basic examinations were not carried out, and he was transferred to an acute admissions unit instead of intensive care, where he died hours later. \"They were side-tracked by the fact he had a learning disability,\" said Dr Lodge. \"I think he would have been treated very differently if that wasn't the case and it's so hard to live with that knowledge.\" A spokeswoman for Humber Health Partnership, the NHS trust which runs the hospital, apologised to the family and said its processes have been changed to ensure patients with learning disabilities receive compassionate treatment at all times. The latest report found 37% of deaths of people with learning disabilities or autism involved some form of delay in care or treatment, while 28% reported instances where diagnosis and treatment guidelines were not met. Andre Strydom, the report's chief investigator and a professor in intellectual disabilities at King's College London, said progress had been made by the NHS in some areas but there was a need for initiatives such as annual health checks and better support for patients with learning disabilities who are admitted to hospital. Richard Keagan-Bull, a research assistant with a learning disability from Kingston University who helped produce the report, told the BBC he found the findings \"really upsetting\". \"People [with learning disabilities] are still dying quite young in hospitals and are not getting the right support and care,\" he said. \"It could be me or it could be somebody I know and I want these deaths to be taken really seriously.\" An NHS spokeswoman said the report showed progress was being made but it was clear more needed to be done to meet the needs of people with learning disabilities. \"The NHS has rolled out training to more than three million health and care staff to improve the care offered to learning disability and autism patients, and all disabled people have a 'reasonable adjustment digital flag' so they are recognised and cared for appropriately when getting NHS support,\" she added. In a statement to the House of Commons, health minister Stephen Kinnock described the difference in life expectancy for those with learning disabilities as \"unacceptable\" but said the number of case reviews which identified good NHS practice had increased by 10% since 2021 and he was committed to driving further improvements. The maternity and paediatric units were closed in May after a watchdog flagged safety concerns. Residents are being asked to increase their awareness in aid of Male Cancer Awareness Week. The NHS vaccination programmes started earlier this month and Wolverhampton resident are urged to get protected. The hospitals in Shrewsbury and Telford will be able to do more teaching and research as a result. The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust says it will need up to 63 extra beds. Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "text": "Vaccination plea after baby's 'terrifying' measles. Nowhere in the north-east of England and Cumbria has the childhood measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination rate of 95% needed to achieve the \"herd immunity\" at which point disease does not spread, latest figures show. Middlesbrough has the lowest rate in the region at 82.5%, but up from 77.9% the previous year. The mother of one child - too young to have the MMR but who could have been protected by herd immunity - said the experience of her having measles at the age of seven months had been \"terrifying\". Medical director for The North East and North Cumbria Integrated Care Board, Dr Catherine Monaghan, warned measles was dangerous and \"one of the most infectious diseases in the world\". Middlesbrough had the region's largest vaccination rate increase in 2024-25 while Cumbria had the highest overall rate in the area but saw it drop slightly from 94.8% in 2023-24 to 94.3%. Of 12 local authority areas in the region, eight have seen a slight or moderate increase but still range between 82% and 94%. Health experts fear a falling vaccination rate could lead to further outbreaks. They say children should have both doses of the MMR jab to be fully protected and prevent the virus being passed on to other children and vulnerable people who have not been able to have it. Singing teacher Scarlett Jones, from Bishop Middleham in County Durham, said her daughter suddenly became seriously ill in August last year. \"She was just laid on her back, staring at the ceiling, very unresponsive,\" the 29-year-old said. The baby's temperature was 39.4C (102.9F), she was becoming more floppy, her eyes were red and swollen, and she was struggling to breathe, she said. Although paramedics arrived within minutes and knew the baby needed to go to hospital, Mrs Jones could not contact her husband Dan, a professional footballer, who was in training. \"They're not allowed their phones at all,\" she said. \"So I rang the club shop and somebody ran down to the field.\" As the baby's temperature continued to rise, doctors first considered sepsis, then meningitis, before she then developed a rash and a consultant found distinctive white spots in her mouth. \"It took a while for them to diagnose measles as they had never seen a case of it before,\" Mrs Jones said. The doctor asked if medical students could be brought in, because they had never seen then disease first hand, she added. Measles normally clears up within seven to 10 days but can cause serious complications. Dr Monaghan said: \"Measles is one of the most infectious diseases in the world and it can be very, very dangerous. \"It can cause pneumonia, it can also cause a swelling of the brain that can leave you with catastrophic, life changing illnesses - so blindness, deafness. \"The worst case scenario is you can die.\" Dr Monaghan said doctors were worried about the resurgence of the virus, with babies and young children, pregnant women, and those with a weakened immune system at increased risk. The disease was 95-98% preventable with the MMR vaccine, she said. Measles had been largely been eradicated but, as the uptake of the jab has fallen, the number of cases has grown. Child health experts have said some parents may not vaccinate their children because they underestimate the seriousness of the disease. After the MMR was introduced, concerns were raised that it was linked to autism. In 1988, researcher Andrew Wakefield incorrectly claimed the two were connected but his work was later dismissed and he was struck off by the General Medical Council in 2010. Rates also fell during the Covid-19 pandemic, as routine appointments were missed. The World Health Organization says 95% of a population needs to be vaccinated to prevent outbreaks and protect the unvaccinated. Figures from the UK Health Security Agency for 2024-25 suggest 91.9% of five-year-olds in England had received one dose of the MMR vaccine, unchanged from the previous year and the lowest level since 2010-11. MMR doses are routinely given at one year old, and three years and four months. Older children and adults can have the jab if they have not been vaccinated earlier. As children head back to school there are concerns that there could be a surge in cases. Dr Monaghan said the two doses gave protection against \"something that can be catastrophic, and potentially fatal\". Follow BBC North East on X and Facebook and BBC Cumbria on X and Facebook and both on Nextdoor and Instagram. Inoculations are available for flu, measles, mumps and rubella. The World Health Organization says a 95% uptake is needed to prevent outbreaks occurring. Health professionals warn there is a \"real risk\" of an outbreak as vaccination rates fall. A campaign is running for both adults and children to have the two doses of the MMR vaccine. East Sussex parents are urged to check whether their children are up to date with vaccinations.

    "text": "AI stethoscope could detect major heart conditions in seconds. Stethoscopes powered by artificial intelligence (AI) could help detect three different heart conditions in seconds, researchers say. The original stethoscope, invented in 1816, allows doctors to listen to the internal sounds of a patient's body. A British team conducted a study using a modern version and say they found it can spot heart failure, heart valve disease and abnormal heart rhythms almost instantly. The tool could be a \"real game-changer\" resulting in patients being treated sooner, the researchers say - with plans to roll the device out across the UK following a study involving 205 GP surgeries  in west and north-west London. The device replaces the traditional chest piece with a device around the size of a playing card. It uses a microphone to analyse subtle differences in heartbeat and blood flow that the human ear cannot detect. It takes an ECG (electrocardiogram), recording electrical signals from the heart, and sends the information to the cloud to be analysed by AI trained on data from tens of thousands of patients. The study by Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust saw more than 12,000 patients from 96 surgeries examined with AI stethoscopes manufactured by US firm Eko Health. They were then compared to patients from 109 GP surgeries where the technology was not used. Those with heart failure were 2.33 times more likely to have it detected within 12 months when examined with the AI stethoscope, researchers said. Abnormal heartbeat patterns, which have no symptoms but can increase stroke risk, were 3.5 times more detectable with the AI stethoscopes, while heart valve disease was 1.9 times more detectable. Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, clinical director at the British Heart Foundation (BHF) and consultant cardiologist, said: \"This is an elegant example of how the humble stethoscope, invented more than 200 years ago, can be upgraded for the 21st century\". Such innovations are vital \"because so often this condition is only diagnosed at an advanced stage when patients attend hospital as an emergency\", she said. \"Given an earlier diagnosis, people can access the treatment they need to help them live well for longer.\" The findings have been presented to thousands of doctors at the European Society of Cardiology annual congress in Madrid, the world's largest heart conference. There are plans to introduce the new stethoscopes to GP practices in south London, Sussex and Wales.

    "text": "Children to be offered chickenpox vaccine on NHS. All young children in the UK will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine by the NHS from January next year. It will be given as two doses, at 12 and 18 months of age, combined with the existing MMR jab which protects against measles, mumps and rubella. A catch up campaign is planned for slightly older children so they don't miss out. Until now, parents who wanted to protect their child against the chickenpox varicella virus, which causes red itchy spots, have usually had to pay up to £200 privately. Ministers hope offering the vaccine free will not only protect youngsters from the severe, although rare, complications of chickenpox, but also save parents taking time off work to look after a sick child. According to the Department of Health and Social Care, chickenpox causes an estimated £24m in lost income and productivity every year in the UK. Health minister Stephen Kinnock said: \"We're giving parents the power to protect their children. \"This vaccine puts children's health first and gives working families the support they deserve.\" The announcement comes as new data revealed none of the main childhood vaccines in England reached the 95% uptake target in 2024/25. Some 91.9% of five-year-olds had received one dose of the MMR vaccine, unchanged from 2023/24 and the lowest level since 2010/11, according to the UKHSA. Chickenpox is generally mild but can be very severe for some people. Pregnant women are particularly at risk as it can cause complications for both the mother and her baby. Very young infants and adults are also more likely to experience serious illness compared to children. In rare cases it can cause a swelling of the brain, called encephalitis, an inflammation of the lungs, called pneumonitis, and stroke, which can result in hospitalisation and, in very rare cases, death. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises UK health departments, recommended the introduction of the vaccine on the NHS in November 2023. Experts say vaccination will dramatically reduce the number of chickenpox cases overall, leading to far fewer of the more serious ones. Dr Gayatri Amirthalingam, deputy director of immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said vaccination could be \"a life saver\" for some. Prof Adam Finn, a paediatrician who was a member of the JCVI, said chickenpox is a \"rotten illness\" that is often thought of as \"trivial\". The vaccine means chickenpox \"is going to be a thing of the past in the near future\", he said. The UK has lagged behind other countries in offering the jab, Prof Finn said, including the US, where it was introduced first in the 1990s. He said the main reason for this was because chickenpox \"lurks around in your body for the rest of your life\" and can later come back as varicella zoster virus (VZV) or shingles. Health experts feared that if chickenpox stopped circulating, \"people wouldn't be re-exposed to the virus, their immunity would wane away and we would see more shingles\". \"Finally, we've now realised that concern is much, much smaller - it's almost non-existent,\" he added. Sarah, who is a mother of two girls, says the vaccine would have helped her young daughters Willow and Mia. Last year they both needed hospital treatment to recover from severe chickenpox. Her youngest, Mia, developed spots \"head to toe\" and had a skin infection, which made her very unwell. \"She was just completely out of it...floppy. \"It was just an awful situation to be in. \"It was absolutely terrifying.\" She said she would advise parents to consider getting the vaccine: \"I would never want any child or any parent to go through what we've been through.\" A shingles vaccine is also available on the NHS for all adults turning 65, those aged 70 to 79 and those aged 50 and over with a severely weakened immune system. People cannot catch shingles from someone with chickenpox. But they can catch chickenpox from someone with shingles if they have not had chickenpox before. It is possible but very unusual to get chickenpox more than once. Speaking about Thursday's data on vaccinations, Kinnock told the BBC the government was concerned about uptake and vaccine hesitancy, which he said increased after the Covid pandemic. National and local campaigns explaining \"the benefits of getting vaccinated and the fact that this is 100% safe\" will be brought forward, he said. He said the government was also committed to combatting disinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccines on social media. \"It's our job as the government, and everybody else out there that is on the side of common sense and reason, to make this case and to win this battle against the conspiracy theorists, and misinformers and disinformers out there who need to be dealt with and need to be silenced,\" Kinnock added. Angie Bunce-Mason, whose daughter died aged three, says the announcement is welcome news. The NHS in England and Wales will start offering the MMRV vaccine to young children from January 2026. A Hampshire man who caught West Nile virus in India is raising awareness of the disease. More than 70 cases of the chikungunya virus were reported in the UK in the first six months of this year. It's hoped phages could give us new ways of treating infections which are immune to antibiotics. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

    "text": "Price of Mounjaro to be discounted in UK pharmacies. The company behind popular weight loss drug Mounjaro has offered a discounted deal to UK suppliers which is expected to limit the price increase to consumers from September. Earlier this month, Eli Lilly announced it was putting up the list price of the drug by as much as 170% which could have meant the cost of the highest dose going up from £122 to £330 per month. But the BBC understands the highest dose will now be sold to suppliers for £247.50. Pharmacies and other private weight-loss services will add their own mark-up to consumers, but it means the price rise for patients is unlikely to be as large as initially feared. Eli Lilly originally said the UK price of Mounjaro had to increase to be more in line with higher prices in Europe and the US. US President Donald Trump had previously complained about the high cost of drugs in the US, compared to other countries, and threatened the pharmaceutical industry if they didn't act. The deal does not affect the price the NHS pays, as the service has negotiated its own heavily-discounted rate for those getting the drug on prescription. The weekly injection works by making you feel full so you eat less, and can help people lose 20% of their body weight. Currently there are thought to be around 1.5 million people on weight loss drugs in the UK with more than half of them on Mounjaro. Estimates suggest nine in 10 pay for these drugs privately, buying from online services and high street pharmacies. Eli Lilly said: \"We are working with private providers on commercial arrangements to maintain affordability and expect these to be passed onto patients when the change is effective on 1 September. \"We are already seeing providers respond in different ways to the list price change, with a range of options available for eligible patients.\" The price the consumer pays depends on which service they buy the weight loss drug from. Some offer more lifestyle and diet support while on the drug than others. The BBC has spoken to a number of services and the price rise for customers may be kept under 50% for the higher doses and even less for the lower doses. Olivier Picard, of the National Pharmacy Association, said: \"Pharmacies will do all they can to support patients when prices change. \"This rebate will mitigate some of the impact of the increase, but patients should still anticipate seeing a rise in prices from 1 September. \"Pharmacies are working hard to support their patients and explore if there are options to minimise disruption to their treatment programme.\"  The maternity and paediatric units were closed in May after a watchdog flagged safety concerns.

    "text": "Seven-week wait for some red flag cancer patients 'frustrating'. Some patients who have been red flagged for breast cancer assessments are waiting up to seven weeks to be seen in Northern Ireland. The target set by Northern Ireland's devolved Department of Health (DOH) - which oversees five health and social care trusts - is 14 days. Judith Mullan, a nurse from Cookstown, who went private for an appointment said she was \"frustrated\" and \"let down\" by waiting times. The DOH said work is ongoing with trusts to increase capacity through additional clinics and workforce planning. BBC News NI understands that several breast cancer consultants are concerned that waiting times have spiralled since a new regional system for handling referrals was introduced. The system was criticised for creating a postcode lottery network as, depending on a patient's address, some were being seen more quickly than others. Before its introduction, health trusts managed their own red flag referrals. In May, all red flag referrals in the Western Trust were seen within 14 days, making it one of the better performing trusts at meeting its target. However, within weeks of the regional system starting, some patients were waiting up to seven weeks, with the latest data showing 250 patients waited more than 14 days for a red flag breast clinic appointment. More than 1,100 people across Northern Ireland are on a red flag list. One health trust source told BBC News NI that the regional system was proving too complex to manage, with projections of waiting lists rising to 11 weeks by the end of September. Judith Mullan, a nurse from Cookstown, said she visited a GP after discovering a lump in her breast. \"I have quite an extensive amount of breast cancer in my family,\" said Judith. Judith's GP red-flagged her for an appointment, and told her it would be a minimum of an eight week wait. \"When my mum had breast cancer, there was a delay in her surgery for two weeks. \"Within that two week period, she went from needing a partial mastectomy to having a full mastectomy.\" Worried that the lump might be cancerous, Judith took out a loan to go private, eventually getting an appointment in Dublin. \"I tried to go private in Northern Ireland but the lists, even in the private clinics, were six to eight weeks. \"The hospital in Dublin gave me an appointment in three days.\" Judith said she feels \"frustrated\" and \"let down\" by the NHS wait times. \"This has had such a negative impact on my mental health. How many people have to die? How many people have to sit and suffer? \"Something needs to be done.\" Judith added: \"My two daughters are going to be facing the same dilemmas as they grow up. I just don't want them to have to go through the same turmoil that I have.\" The Northern Trust said: \"We very much regret that anyone is waiting longer than the 14 day target for red flag breast assessment referrals. \"We recognise, however, that the overall waiting time for those awaiting assessment is too long, and acknowledge the stress and anxiety this can cause.\" Mary O'Hagan, from Maghera in County Londonderry, was red-flagged for a breast cancer assessment by her GP after discovering a hot red patch on her right breast. When she was referred, Mary, who is still waiting for an appointment, was told the waiting time used to be two weeks but she could now expected to wait eight or nine weeks. \"When any woman finds a lump your stomach just drops\", she told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme. \"The first thing we think of is breast cancer, you think of everything that could be ahead of you, going home to tell your family and where you could be at in three months' time or six months' time.\" Mary, who swam an English channel relay in June, said that her current situation made her feel \"stressed\". \"As soon as I finish one thing I book the next thing, I'm kind of in limbo at the minute for I don't know where I am going to be at in three months' time,\" she said. She said it was \"shocking\" that early detection was potentially being affected.\" \"It's obviously not working, maybe they need to get back around the table and have another look at this and get patients seen a lot sooner\". The new red flag initiative was announced in May by Health Minister Mike Nesbitt in response to the \"unacceptable\" waiting times for breast cancer services in Northern Ireland. The aim was to enable people from across all the health trusts to access the earliest appointment available to them, no matter where they live. For instance, patients living in the South Eastern Health Trust have been offered referrals and screening appointments in the Western Health Trust including at the weekend. Not all patients, however, are able to make that journey or a weekend appointment. Nesbitt said that it was not acceptable for women in one trust area to have to wait significantly longer to be assessed than women in another trust area \"so this will help address the disparities between the trusts\". As the system has been operating for about three months, others have said it needs time to bed in and that summer leave among medics has also been an issue. Sources have told the BBC some of the health trusts felt they were in a better position to manage the lists, but as some breast units were better staffed than others, this did not produce an equitable appointment system. In a statement, the Department of Health (DOH) told BBC News NI while the regional approach aims to equalise waiting times and improve fairness, it does not in itself reduce the overall waiting time. They added that it does not directly increase the number of appointments but significantly improves how existing capacity is utilised. The DOH said they recognise that there is a core demand, amounting to almost 4 clinics per week. To help address the demand, the DOH has secured £5m recurrent funding to increase HSCT's core capacity. The department said they will continue to monitor the situation closely and are committed to improving access to timely and appropriate care.

A doctor has been struck off for assaulting a woman, making racist or derogatory comments and uploading an image of a patient's brain on his dating profile. Dr Sayed Talibi, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, was sanctioned by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) after it found his fitness to practise was impaired. Other examples of his misconduct included threatening a woman with waterboarding, posing for pictures with weapons and stealing milk powder worth £23.50 from Asda. The tribunal decided to erase Dr Talibi's name from the General Medical Council's register, effective immediately. The MPTS record of the tribunal, which concluded on 8 August, said Dr Talibi: The chairman of the panel, Andrew Lewis, said Dr Talibi's conduct was \"fundamentally incompatible with his continued registration\". \"It [the tribunal] concluded that erasure was the only sanction that it could impose given the seriousness of the misconduct, the lack of insight and remediation shown, and the risk of repetition that remained,\" he wrote in the report. He said allowing him to return to \"unrestricted practice\" would be inconsistent with the findings due to the \"seriousness\" of Dr Talibi's misconduct.

Allergic reactions to foods such as pine nuts and goat's milk happen frequently enough they may need warning labels, say experts. Food packaging in the UK and EU already lists the most common allergens for people to be aware of, such as egg, peanuts and sesame. But at least four more could be added to the mandatory risk list, according to an article in the journal Clinical & Experimental Allergy. Lead investigator Dr Dominique Sabouraud-Leclerc from the Allergy Vigilance Network said evidence of increased reactions to a wider range of foods suggested it was time to review the list of foods with mandatory labels and consider adding \"at least the most severe of these emerging food allergens\".  The foods the researchers say should be added to the list now are: And other emerging ones to keep a watch on are: The recommendation comes from experts who looked at food-induced anaphylaxis cases reported in Europe between 2002–2023. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that is a medical emergency. Symptoms, such as swollen lips and throat and difficulty breathing, can happen very quickly. People who know they are allergic to certain foods can carry an adrenalin auto-injector pen in case they need urgent treatment. The researchers analysed nearly 3,000 cases and 413, including two deaths, were caused by one of the eight emerging food allergies. Based on their frequency, severity, recurrence, and potential for hidden exposure,  the top four new ones are goat's and sheep's milk, buckwheat, peas and lentil, and pine nuts. That would put them in the same list as the current 14: The Food Standards Agency says it recognises that there are a significant number of foods that can cause allergies or intolerances. “This is why pre-packed foods must list all ingredients, why food businesses must provide clear information about allergens and why we encourage consumers to speak up about their allergies,” said spokesman Dr James Cooper. Allergy UK said it was calling for full ingredient labelling on all food products while keeping an eye on worrying trends. \"We are closely monitoring emerging allergens and recently issued advice to people with a pea allergy,\" said Simone Miles, the charity's chief executive. \"Pea is not one of the 14 allergens currently required by law to be listed, yet pea protein is increasingly being added to a wide range of foods, including in products where it may not be expected. \"We have also raised concerns about platforms such as TikTok Shop, where many products lack clear and accurate labelling,\" Ms Miles said.

    "text": "Hospital pays out after bacteria-linked deaths. A hospital trust has paid a \"six-figure settlement package\" in the case of nine patients following an outbreak of a bacterial infection linked to its water supply. Three patients died and two of these cases were as a result of complications connected to the outbreak at Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, according to lawyers. Lung transplant patients Karen Starling, 54, of Ipswich, died in February 2020, and Anne Martinez, of Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, died in December 2020. Eilish Midlane, the hospital's chief executive, said: \"Lessons have been learnt [and] regulations revised to seek to avoid a similar occurrence in the UK.\" The trust denied liability but resolved each of the claims in out-of-court settlements, which were secured following a civil claim pursued as a group action. Six further patients suffered serious complications that continue to affect them following the outbreak of Mycobacterium abscessus (M.abscessus), according to legal firm Irwin Mitchell. Lawyers said the \"six-figure settlement package\" was agreed in connection with the nine cases. M.abscessus is a bacterial infection which is a particular risk to people who are vulnerable and immunosuppressed, such as lung transplant patients. Solicitor Jatinder Paul said patients were admitted to \"this world-renowned hospital... in the hope of a better life\". \"While the surgical care itself hasn't been an issue, the events that unfolded have been devastating for them and their families,\" he said. He added large public buildings with complex water systems, such as hospitals, can be at an increased risk of waterborne contamination. Inquests were held in 2022 into the deaths of Mrs Starling and Mrs Martinez, who both underwent double-lung transplants in 2019 and died the following year. Keith Morton, the assistant coroner for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, found that their M. abscessus was a hospital-acquired infection. In a joint statement, Mrs Martinez's sons Tony, 43, and Andrew 38, said: \"We hoped that when mum underwent her transplant it would be the start of a brighter future. \"Even six years on from mum's transplant, it's difficult to comprehend the events that unfolded.\" Mrs Starling's husband Derek, said: \"Losing Karen in such circumstances is something our family will never truly come to terms with.\" Ms Midlane said her \"thoughts go out to the patients and families involved\". \"We recognise this [settlement] has been possible due to the cooperative approach adopted by all parties, for which we are very grateful. \"Providing safe and compassionate patient care is our top priority and as part of our investigation in 2019, we worked tirelessly to investigate, understand, manage and control the outbreak. \"As acknowledged by Irwin Mitchell, we acted appropriately and complied with all the relevant regulations.

    "text": "Warning issued over branded kids' magnesium gummies. Parents are being warned to stop using Nutrition Ignition Kids Magnesium Glycinate Gummies, due to them containing an undeclared drug called melatonin that could cause issues for children. Melatonin is a prescription-only medicine, which can cause drowsiness, headaches, dizziness and nausea. Testing of two batches by the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found the products, which have now been pulled from sale, contained between 1.5mg and 1.7mg of melatonin. Anyone who has given the product to a child is advised to speak to a healthcare professional if they notice any adverse side effects, although lasting harm is not expected. Melatonin can be given to children over the age of six for sleep management if other methods have failed. It is often used for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or delayed sleep wake phase disorder (DSWPD) and for the short-term treatment of insomnia. Children can be prescribed a starting dose of 1mg, up to 5mg of melatonin per day and no serious side effects have been identified in studies of children. The gummies in question were recommended for children above the age of four to help support \"calm, focus and digestion\". Magnesium glycinate is supposed to help support muscle function, improve sleep quality and regulate the body's nervous system. Parents are being advised to dispose of the item at a local pharmacy and report any side effects to the MHRA Yellow Card scheme. The Nutrition Ignition brand website has now been deleted and products have been removed from online retailers such as Amazon and eBay. As reported by The Guardian in June, the gummy brand was owned by Surrey-based NHS clinical therapy lead Sally Westcott. She was ordered to remove the raspberry-flavoured gummies from sale more than a month ago by the MHRA after they were alerted to the sweets' hidden ingredients by two concerned mothers. The women had the gummies tested when they noticed their young children falling asleep more quickly than usual after consuming them and it was then discovered that they contained melatonin. Westcott, who is yet to comment on the MHRA report, said in June that she had \"never knowingly sold products containing undeclared ingredients\".

    "text": "What are UV levels and how can you protect yourself?. Warm weather can often bring high levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV radiation is emitted by the Sun and penetrates the Earth's atmosphere. Some exposure is essential for our wellbeing, but too much can cause skin damage. UV is beneficial because it enables our skin to produce essential vitamin D. This is important for the function of bones, blood cells and our immune system. But we need to be careful about how much time we spend in the sunshine, warns Prof Dorothy Bennett, from St George's, University of London. \"Every exposure to UV, especially every sunburn, increases our risk of skin cancer. \"Melanoma, the most dangerous skin cancer, is now the fifth commonest cancer in the UK, the ongoing rise being attributed to sunbathing.\" UV radiation promotes skin cancer by damaging DNA in skin cells. It also plays a substantial role in skin ageing, contributing to wrinkles and loosened folds. UV exposure has also been linked to eye problems, including cataracts. Levels of UV radiation vary throughout the day. The highest readings occur in the four-hour period around \"solar noon\", when the sun is at its highest - usually from late morning to early afternoon. The UV Index (or UVI) is a standard, international measure of ultraviolet radiation. Values start at zero and can rise above 10. The higher the number, the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eyes - and the less time it takes for harm to occur. Countries close to the equator can experience very high UV levels in the middle of the day, throughout the year. Nairobi in Kenya can have UV levels above 10 all year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Majorca in Spain normally hits nine in June and July. But the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic never usually get above five, even in summer. According to the WHO, no sun protection is required when levels are: Some sun protection is required when levels are: Extra sun protection is required when UV levels are: Children are more sensitive to UV radiation than adults, and therefore require additional protection at lower levels. The NHS advises: Global research shows people often miss parts of their bodies when putting on sunscreen, according to Dr Bav Shergill from the British Association of Dermatologists. \"People often forget the side of their nose - where I have seen a lot of skin cancer,\" he says. Other areas which need to be covered include the temples and the upper chest. As a guide, adults should aim to apply about six to eight teaspoons of sunscreen if covering the entire body. There is no safe or healthy way to get a tan, according to the NHS. Dr Shergill recommends using self-tan products instead. \"When you tan, ultraviolet light stimulates your skin cells to produce pigment to try and protect the DNA of skin cells - but that protection is minimal -  the equivalent of SP4. \"That is not much protection at all - so you can still burn very early,\" he warns. The amount of UV reaching your skin is not driven by the daily temperature, says Dr Michaela Hegglin, from the University of Reading. \"UV levels on a bright and breezy late April day in the UK will be about the same as a warm sunny day in August.\" \"Your skin can burn just as quickly whether it's 30C or 20C,\" warns BBC Weather's BBC Weather's Helen Willetts. \"Don't be caught out on cloudy days. UV will still penetrate thin clouds - so even if you don't think it's that sunny, you can still burn.\" Yes, according to Dr Shergill. \"The skin may look darker, but it doesn’t always behave that way from a protection point of view  – because there are more genes at play than we think about,\" he says. \"I have, for example, seen South Asian people with skin cancer and I have seen people with dual-heritage get skin cancer.\" The broader risks of eye damage and harmful effects on the immune system from too much UV radiation affect people of all skin colour. The number of Japanese centenarians rose to 99,763 in September, with women making up 88% of the total. Stafford Borough Council now plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2035, instead of 2040. The centre is said to be a significant milestone in protecting the future resilience of UK forests.

    "text": "What does hot weather do to the body?. Hot weather during the summer can affect anyone, but some people run a greater risk of serious harm. Experts recommend checking on those who may be more vulnerable, such as older people and babies. As the body gets hotter, blood vessels open up. This leads to lower blood pressure and makes the heart work harder to push the blood around the body. This process can cause mild symptoms such as an itchy heat rash or swollen feet. At the same time, sweating leads to the loss of fluids and salt and, crucially, the balance between them in the body changes. This, combined with the lowered blood pressure, can lead to heat exhaustion. Symptoms include: If blood pressure drops too far, the risk of heart attacks rises. Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37C whether we are in a snowstorm or a heatwave. That is the temperature at which our bodies have evolved to work. But as the weather gets hotter, it is harder for the body to keep its core temperature down. It opens more blood vessels near the skin to lose heat to our surroundings and starts sweating. As the sweat evaporates, it dramatically increases the heat lost from the skin. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) recommends looking out for those who may struggle to keep cool, such as older people, those with underlying conditions and and those who live alone. Other advice includes: Anyone tempted to cool off in rivers and open water should consult local warning signs and consider any hidden dangers. No one - especially babies, young children and animals - should ever be left in a locked vehicle. If you see someone you think has heat exhaustion, the NHS says you should: If they can be cooled down within half an hour, then heat exhaustion is not normally serious. However, if they do not recover within 30 minutes, then they are at risk of heatstroke. This is a medical emergency and you should call 999 immediately. People with heatstroke may stop sweating even though they are too hot. Their temperature could go over 40C and they might have seizures or lose consciousness. People who are older or have some long-term conditions - such as heart disease -  are sometimes less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body. Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it. People who are homeless will also be more exposed to the sun. Those living in top-floor flats will also face higher temperatures. Yes - but the NHS says people should keep taking their medication as normal, and focus on staying cool and hydrated. Diuretics - sometimes called \"water pills\" - increase the amount of water the body expels. They are taken widely, including for heart failure. In high temperatures, they increase the dangers of dehydration and imbalances in key minerals in the body. Antihypertensives - which lower blood pressure - can combine with the blood vessels that are dilating to cope with the heat and cause dangerous drops in blood pressure. Some drugs for epilepsy and Parkinson's can block sweating and make it harder for the body to cool itself. Other drugs such as lithium or statins can become more concentrated and problematic in the blood if there is too much fluid loss. During 2022 - which saw the highest recorded temperature in England at 40.3°C - there were an estimated 2,985 so-called \"excess deaths\" as a result of the heat. Most heat-related excess deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes caused by the strain of trying to keep body temperatures stable. The higher death rate starts to kick in once the thermometer passes 25C-26C. However, evidence suggests the deaths tend to be caused by higher temperatures in spring or early summer rather than during \"peak summer\". This could be because we start to change our day-to-day behaviour as summer progresses and we get more used to dealing with the heat. The evidence from previous heatwaves is the increase in deaths happens very quickly - within the first 24 hours of a heatwave. The rain and high winds experienced during stormy weather can damage homes and cause power outages. People with learning disabilities die 20 years earlier than others. The hottest day was 30 June, with highs of 33.4C (92F) in Jersey and 30.4C (87F) in Guernsey. Air-con sales are rising but there are fears over its medical, financial and environmental impacts. Without 'decent rain', trees and plants are facing the stress of the drought, experts say. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

    "text": "When is it too hot to walk your dog?. As temperatures rise across much of the UK, it's not just humans who feel the heat. What can you do to make sure your pets are cool and comfortable? The RSPCA says that exercise is the most frequent trigger of heatstroke for dogs and advises adjusting your routine during hot weather. It says there is no \"safe\" temperature for walks, as it depends on your dog's breed, age, health and temperament. The charity also recommends the pavement test: if you can't comfortably hold your hand on the ground for five seconds, it's too hot for your dog's paws. If you do walk your dog, go out in the early morning or late evening, look for shaded areas and walk on grass where possible. The charity says these signs could mean your dog is suffering in the heat: You should also avoid running or cycling with your dog when it is hot. If your dog is getting less exercise than usual, the RSPCA suggests keeping them engaged at home with puzzle toys or training games. Some dogs are more at risk of heatstroke than others. This includes those with underlying health conditions or thick coats which can trap heat. Puppies or older dogs may also struggle to regulate their temperature. Dogs pant to keep themselves cool, but the shorter snouts of certain flat-faced breeds like bulldogs and pugs make this difficult. This means they are at particular risk from overheating. According to the PDSA, symptoms of heatstroke include: If you see these signs, first try to cool your dog down as quickly as possible. Move them to a shaded area and slowly pour any available water that's cooler than the dog's temperature over their body, avoiding their head in case they are struggling to breathe. Do not cover them in damp or wet towels as this can trap heat. The faster you can bring their temperature down, the lower the risk of serious injury. Once your pet has started to cool down, contact your vet for guidance and possible further treatment. The RSPCA says it is essential that animals have access to shaded spaces inside and outside. Provide plenty of clean water - you can add ice cubes to their water bowl. Pets may also enjoy frozen edible snacks. Put wet or damp towels underneath their body - but don't place them directly on top. Several pet cooling mats and jackets are available, but make sure you follow the  instructions. Products that need to be kept constantly wet can actually make your pet hotter if they dry out. Some animals may enjoy playing with frozen toys, or cooling off in a paddling pool – although you should always supervise pets around water. Keeping dogs and other furry animals like cats well-groomed prevents the build-up of matted fur, which can make it harder for them to stay cool. Make sure any indoor animal cages or fish tanks are not in direct sunlight. Never leave a pet in a locked car, caravan or other vehicle for any length of time, as temperatures can rise quickly to dangerous levels - which can be fatal. Similarly, don't leave animals shut inside conservatories, sheds or greenhouses. You may also want to leave out extra water in your garden for birds, foxes and other wildlife creatures. Dogs and cats can get sunburnt - especially if they are light-coloured or have thin patches of fur. Ears, noses, eyelids and bellies are also vulnerable. Sunburn can be painful for pets, and in extreme cases can lead to skin cancer. Some active ingredients in human sun cream are toxic to pets so vets recommend using a pet-safe waterproof sunscreen, with an SPF rating of 30 or higher. Some companies sell sunscreen with a bitter taste to stop animals licking it off. The PDSA suggests you apply sunscreen to a small area of skin first, and leave it for 24 hours to ensure the animal does not react. Once you know the sunscreen is safe, you can gently apply a thin layer of sunscreen on the exposed white and light patches of skin, plus their nose and ears. The PDSA warns pet owners to look out for the following symptoms of sunburn: The Dogs Trust advises owners to first check whether the beach they want to visit allows dogs. If it does, the charity recommends taking plenty of fresh water and making sure your dog doesn't drink sea water. Check the temperature of the sand and, if there's no natural shade, try to create some with a beach umbrella, sun tent or windbreak. If your dog likes to go in the sea, check the tide times and make sure you understand any swimming hazards. Keep your dog on a lead when you are near fast-flowing water or cliff edges. When you leave the beach rinse any sand and seawater off their coat and paws with tap water to stop it causing any irritation.

    "text": "Why the world is watching RFK's fight with US health agency. In fiery Senate testimony this week, US Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr once again set his sights on the nation's top public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). His appearance came days after he suddenly fired the new CDC director, Susan Monarez, provoking a group of senior staff to resign in protest. At the hearing, when asked for an explanation, Kennedy claimed he had asked Ms Monarez if she was a \"trustworthy person\" and she had replied \"no\", to some disbelief from his opponents in the room. He then admitted he had once described the CDC as the \"most corrupt\" agency in government, and strongly hinted he's not finished with his plans to shake up the organisation. Kennedy's words have sparked a furious backlash, with many doctors and scientists increasingly concerned that America's public health systems are being dangerously compromised. It's a conflict that could have a significant impact not just on health policy in the US but across the world. In the past, the CDC has been instrumental in global health, leading the response to crises from famine, to HIV, to Ebola. Founded in 1946, the CDC tracks emerging infectious diseases like Covid and is also tasked with tackling long-term or chronic conditions such as heart disease and cancer. It operates more than 200 specialised laboratories and employs 13,000 people, although that number has been cut by around 2,000 since President Donald Trump returned to office. It does not approve or licence vaccines. That responsibility lies with the Food and Drug Administration. But it does produce official recommendations on who should receive which vaccines through a panel of experts - known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) - and monitors their side effects and other safety concerns. It was Kennedy's record on vaccines which particularly worried many public health experts when he took office in February. An activist group he ran for eight years, Children's Health Defense, repeatedly questioned the safety and efficacy of vaccination. He has described the Covid jab as the \"most deadly in history\" and has blamed rising rates of autism on vaccines, an idea that has been categorically debunked by large scientific studies over many years. So feathers were seriously ruffled just weeks into his tenure when it emerged he had hired a noted vaccine critic, David Geier, to look again at the CDC data on that scientifically disproven link. Then in June, Kennedy suddenly sacked the entire ACIP panel which advises the CDC on vaccine eligibility after accusing all 17 members of being \"plagued with persistent conflicts of interest\". A new committee, handpicked by the administration, now has the power to change, or even drop, critical recommendations to immunise Americans for certain diseases, as well as shape the childhood vaccination programme, although the CDC itself still has the final say on whether to accept that advice. It's that decision which has now been linked to the firing of the agency's new director in late August, only 29 days into the job. In a newspaper article this week Ms Monarez said she was sacked from the CDC after being told, by Kennedy, to \"pre-approve\" the recommendations of the ACIP committee which she said had now been filled with people who have expressed \"antivaccine rhetoric\". \"It is imperative that the panel's recommendations aren't rubber-stamped but instead are rigorously and scientifically reviewed before being accepted or rejected,\" she wrote. \"I lost my job, America's children could lose far more.\" In his testimony Kennedy stood his ground, accusing her of lying about that exchange and describing her dismissal as \"absolutely necessary\". \"We need bold, competent and creative new leadership at CDC, people able and willing to chart a new course,\" he said. Ms Monarez's sacking led to a fresh wave of resignations at the agency as senior staff continue to walk out. Over the last two weeks the CDC has lost its chief medical officer, its director of immunisation and its director of emerging diseases, amongst others. \"A huge top tier of CDC leadership has been removed, but this is also in the wake of the firing of thousands of CDC workers, including many well-respected experts,\" says Dr Fiona Havers, a senior vaccine researcher who herself resigned from the agency in June. \"I'm a physician, and for my own integrity as a scientist, I did not feel I could continue to serve in that administration when it felt like the data we were putting together was not going to be used in an evidenced, science-based way.\" Kennedy was also criticised by some CDC staff for what they felt was a lacklustre response to a shooting at the agency's Atlanta headquarters in August. The gunman, who reportedly believed the Covid vaccine had made him sick, killed a policeman before turning the weapon on himself. Kennedy visited the offices in the aftermath but he did not meet with staff members and continued to criticise the agency's performance. He did, though, start his testimony this week with a tribute to David Rose, the police officer who died in the shooting. For the moment, Jim O'Neill, one of Kennedy's top advisers, has been tapped up to run the CDC on an interim basis, until a new permanent director can be found. Mr O'Neill served in several roles in the health department under President George W Bush, but he has a business rather than a science background. \"During the previous administration, CDC lost public trust by manipulating health data to support a political narrative,\" he wrote on social media on the day he was appointed. \"We are helping the agency earn back the trust it has squandered.\" More changes are certainly likely. In his Senate hearing Kennedy said the CDC had lied to Americans in the pandemic about mask wearing, social distancing and the ability of the vaccine to stop the transmission of coronavirus. \"I need to fire some of those people and make sure this doesn't happen again,\" he said. The next flashpoint could come later this month. On 18 September the CDC's new vaccine advisory panel is due to meet to discuss Covid vaccines and other shots, including for hepatitis B and the RSV virus. The panel's recommendations and the CDC's response will be carefully scrutinised, not just in the US but around the world. \"What happens in America is of great importance,\" says Anthony Costello, a former director at the World Health Organization (WHO) and a professor of public health at University College London. \"We've done so much to protect science from political interference over the past 200 years and the concern is that America will pay a price for it and we might too, if we go in that direction.\" In the past, CDC teams have also had a major hands-on role in global health protection. In 2015, for example, the agency had 3,000 staff working on the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, with 1,200 of those on the ground in west Africa. After taking office, President Trump withdrew the US from the WHO and ordered the CDC to cut off all communication with the organisation. The concern from former CDC staffers like Dr Fiona Havers  is what might happen if and when the next Ebola or Covid is eventually spotted and starts spreading. \"Taking a sledgehammer to the CDC and undercutting its programmes has left the US much less prepared for another pandemic,” she says. “And that really has huge implications globally if another health emergency were to arise.” The deployment of the National Guard to Memphis comes roughly a month after he sent troops to Washington DC. \"We got him,\" Utah Governor Spencer Cox said after authorities apprehended Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspected of killing the conservative activist. Kirk's loyalty towards the first family put him at the very centre of Donald Trump's Maga movement. The governor said a family member told investigators that the suspect had become \"more political\" in recent years.

    "text": "The trade in US body parts that's completely legal - but ripe for exploitation. Harold Dillard was 56 when he was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer around his abdomen in November 2009. Within weeks the former car mechanic and handyman - a Texan \"Mr Fix It\" type who wore a cowboy hat and jeans nearly every day - was in end-of-life hospice care. In his final days, Mr Dillard was visited at the hospice by a company called Bio Care. They asked if he might like to donate his body to medical science, where it could be used by doctors to practise knee replacement surgery. The company would cremate the parts of his body that weren't used and return his ashes free of charge. \"His eyes lit up,\" his daughter, Farrah Fasold, remembers. \"He viewed that as lessening the burden on his family. Donating his body was the last selfless thing he could do.\" Mr Dillard died on Christmas Eve, and within hours, a car from Bio Care pulled up outside the hospice and drove his body away. A few months later, his daughter received a call from the police. They had found her father's head. At the company's warehouse, police say they found more than 100 body parts belonging to 45 people. \"All of the bodies appeared to have been dismembered by a coarse cutting instrument, such as a chainsaw,\" a detective wrote at the time. Ms Fasold says she imagined her father's body would be handled with respect - but instead it was \"mutilated\", she believes. \"I would close my eyes at night and see huge red tubs filled with body parts. I had insomnia. I wasn't sleeping.\" The company said at the time through a lawyer that they denied mistreating bodies. The firm no longer exists, and its former owners could not be reached for comment. This was Ms Fasold's first introduction to the world of so-called body brokers: private companies that acquire corpses, dissect them, and then sell the limbs for a profit, often to medical research centres. For critics, the industry represents a modern form of grave-robbing. Others argue that body-donation is essential for medical research and that private companies are simply filling a gap left by universities, who consistently fail to acquire enough dead bodies to support their education and research programmes. Although Ms Fasold didn't realise it at the time, her father's case sheds light on an emotion-fuelled debate that cuts to the centre of our ideas about life, and what it means to have a dignified death. Since at least the 19th Century, when the teaching of medicine expanded, some scientifically-minded people have rather liked the idea that their corpse could be used to train doctors. Brandi Schmitt is director of the anatomical donation programme at the University of California, a popular destination for people wishing to bequeath their bodies. She says last year they received 1,600 \"whole-body donations\", and they have a list of almost 50,000 living people who have already registered to do so. Often, body-donation is driven by simple altruism, she says: \"A  lot of people are either educated or interested in education.\" But financial factors come into play too. Funerals are expensive, Ms Schmitt says; many are tempted by the prospect of their body being taken away for free. The Body Shop Conversations with body brokers, scientists and affected families shed light on this murky industry. Listen on BBC Sounds or on BBC Radio 4 at 13:30 BST on Sunday 31 August. Produced by Jacob Dabb and 2 Degrees West. Like most medical schools, the University of California does not profit from its body-donation programme, and it has strict guidelines for how corpses - or cadavers, as they are known medically - should be handled. But in recent decades, something more controversial has emerged in the US: a network of for-profit businesses that act as middlemen, acquiring bodies from individuals, dissecting them, and then selling them on. They are widely nicknamed body brokers,  though the firms call themselves \"non-transplant tissue banks\". Some of their customers are universities, which use cadavers to train doctors. Others are medical engineering firms, which use limbs to test products like new hip implants. The for-profit body part trade is effectively outlawed in the UK and other European countries, but looser regulation in the US has allowed the trade to flourish. The largest investigation of its kind - conducted by Reuters journalist Brian Grow, in 2017 - identified 25 for-profit body broking companies in the US. One of them earned $12.5m (£9.3m) over three years from the body-part business. Some of those firms are broadly respected, and claim to follow rigorous ethical guidelines. Others have been accused of disrespecting the dead and exploiting vulnerable people in grief. The trade has grown because of a gap in US regulation, says Jenny Kleeman, who spent years researching the topic for her book, The Price of Life. Whilst the UK's Human Tissue Act makes it illegal in almost all cases to profit from a body part, no comparable law exists in the US. Technically, the US's Uniform Anatomical Gift Act bans the sale of human tissue - but the same law allows you to charge a \"reasonable amount\" for the \"processing\" of a body part. These loose laws have turned the US into a global exporter of cadavers. In her book, Kleeman found that one of the largest US players shipped body parts to more than 50 countries, including the UK. \"In many countries, there is a shortfall of donations,\" Ms Kleeman says. \"And where they can get bodies is from America.\" There is no formal register of brokers, and official statistics are hard to find. But Reuters calculated that, from 2011 to 2015, private brokers in the US received at least 50,000 bodies, and distributed more than 182,000 body parts. For some, private body brokers represent the very worst sort of ambulance-chasing greed. In his Reuters investigation, Mr Grow found cases of brokers becoming \"intertwined with the American funeral industry\" via arrangements in which funeral homes introduce brokers to relatives of the recently-deceased. In return, the home received a referral fee, sometimes exceeding $1,000 (£750). Horror stories are easy to find - and because of the US's light regulation, there's often no legal recourse when things go wrong. After her run-in with Bio Care, Ms Fasold hoped for a criminal prosecution. As well as the fact that her father's limbs may have been cut with a chainsaw, she was unhappy about a package she had received in the post, in a zip-lock bag, which the company claimed was her father's ashes. She says the contents did not look or feel like human ashes. Bio Care's owner was initially charged with fraud, but the charge was later withdrawn because prosecutors could not prove an intent to deceive. Increasingly desperate, Ms Fasold contacted the local district prosecutor. But she was told that Bio Care had not broken any state criminal laws. Equally as controversial are \"bodies of the state\" donations - when a homeless person dies on the street, or somebody dies in hospital without known next-of-kin, and their corpse is donated to science. In theory, county officials first try to find relatives; only if they cannot locate anyone is the body given away. But the BBC has heard that this may not always happen. Last year, Tim Leggett was scrolling a news app at his home in Texas when he found a list of local people whose bodies had been used in this way. He was shocked to see the name of his older brother, Dale, a forklift truck-operator who had died of respiratory failure a year earlier. His brother's body was used by a for-profit medical education company to train anaesthesiologists. It was one of more than 2,000 unclaimed bodies given to the University of North Texas Health Science Center between 2019 and 2024, under agreements with the Dallas and Tarrant counties. \"I was angry,\" Mr Leggett says. \"He would not want to be an object of discussion, or [to have] people pointing at him.\" His brother was a quiet man who mostly \"just wanted to be left alone\", Mr Leggett remembers, and his aversion to technology made it difficult to stay in touch. Still, Mr Leggett says his brother was a human, like anyone else, who deserved dignity in death. \"He liked Marvel comic books; he had a cat that he named Cat,\" he remembers. In a statement to the BBC, the University of North Texas Health Science Center gave its \"deepest apologies\" to the affected families, and said it was \"refocusing\" its programme on education and \"improv[ing] the quality of health for families and future generations\". Since the story first emerged last year, they said, they have fired staff who oversaw the programme. But horror stories like these aside, others point out that body donation plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. Ms Schmitt of the University of California says that at the most basic level, bodies are used to teach doctors, or for surgeons to practise complicated operations. Often, it's the first time a medical student works with real flesh and blood - an experience that can't be replicated from a textbook. \"Those students will go on to help people,\" she says. Then there are the cadavers used to help engineer new treatments. Ms Schmitt points to a number of technologies that were only developed, she says, after being tested on bodies. These include knee and hip replacements, robotic surgery, and pacemakers. And some of the private brokers say they are being unfairly villainised. Kevin Lowbrera, who works for one of the big \"body broking\" companies, says its accreditation by the American Association of Tissue Banks means it has to follow guidelines determining how cadavers are treated and stored. Accreditation is voluntary - seven companies have signed up - and a private broker doesn't need it to operate legally. The problem is not with honest companies like his, Mr Lowbrera says - it is with the rogue players. \"There are still programmes out there that are not accredited. I tell people all the time, stay away from them,\" he says. It would be wrong to regulate his whole industry out of existence, he says, because of some bad apples. Virtually everyone I speak to - on all sides of the debate - thinks that more regulation in the US is needed. So, what could that look like? Ms Schmitt, of the University of California, suggests the US could perhaps follow European countries and ban for-profit body broking. She says there are some \"legitimate costs\" that come with processing a body - like spending on transport, and preservative chemicals. It's reasonable for companies to charge for these, she says. But the idea of actually making a profit makes many feel squeamish. \"The ability to sell or profit from human remains I think complicates the altruistic idea of donating for education,\" she says. She suggests the US could emulate its own policy on organ donation - which is governed by the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, and prohibits the sale of organs. But the author Ms Kleeman says that if the US banned for-profit body donation tomorrow, there simply wouldn't be enough cadavers to go around. \"If you don't want there to be a trade in these body parts, we need to get a way of more people donating altruistically,\" she says. She urges universities to launch more robust promotional campaigns, asking directly for body donations. \"There isn't the same public awareness campaign as there is for organ donation, for example.\" Once this shortage is addressed, she says, then the US could ban for-profit donation. It's also possible that advances in virtual reality (VR) technology mean that cadavers simply won't be needed in the future. A trainee doctor could simply put on a headset and practice on a computer-generated patient. In 2023, Case Western Reserve University became one of the first medical schools in the United States to remove human bodies from its training programme, and replace them with VR models. Real human bodies preserve the \"body's colours and textures, [which] can make it difficult to discern, say, a nerve from a blood vessel\", Mark Griswold, a professor at the school, told the website Lifewire at the time. In contrast, their computer programme \"gives students a crystal clear 3D map of these anatomical structures and their relationships to each other\", he said. But Ms Kleeman says that, in general, VR technology is not yet good enough to replicate practicing on a cadaver. For the time being, it seems, there will remain a demand for human bodies - as well as money to be made.

    "text": "Sitting up straight isn't the only secret to good posture - here are three more tips. \"Sit up straight!\" - we've all heard that command barked at us many times. For years we've been told that good posture means standing tall, shoulders back and your spine straight as a rod. But that might not actually be true. According to Dr Xand van Tulleken, a doctor and BBC presenter, much of what we think we know about posture is outdated. In fact, trying to hold yourself bolt upright all day could do more harm than good, he told Morning Live. As the end of summer looms and many people return to work and studying, here are his three suggestions to improve your posture and in turn help look after your back. Posture is dynamic, not static. The worst thing you can do is stay locked in one position for hours whether that's being perched at a desk, lounging on the sofa or scrolling on your phone. Dr Xand says the key is to change it up. There are lots of posture corrector straps, back braces and chairs that promise to change your life but \"you just need to be moving around in the day\". A lumbar cushion or an ergonomic chair can make sitting more comfortable and a wearable posture reminder might nudge you to stop hunching but none of these replace the basics of movement, strength and listening to your body. \"You can have the best chair, but if you spend eight hours sitting in it you'll still have back pain.\" Dr Xand also cautions that some back gadgets marketed as improving posture can force you into one position that constrains and restricts your movement and that's the opposite of what you want to be doing. Make sure you stand, stretch and take regular breaks - even small shifts can reset your muscles, he says. Good posture comes from strong muscles, but that doesn't mean you need a gym membership or Olympic ambitions. Dr Xand suggests regular exercises to build a stronger core and back. Simple movements like raising your arms above your head and turning your head from side to side \"can lift some tension and help you feel instantly better\". \"What we want is for our body to support itself,\" Dr Xand explains. Exercises like pilates and yoga can be a good way to stretch your body and target specific pain points, he says. The NHS website also suggests simple exercises which can be done at home to improve your strength. Posture isn't just about muscles, it's also about mindset. The way we sit, stand and move often reflects how stressed we're feeling about what we're doing. Hunched shoulders at a laptop can be as much about deadlines as desk set-up so it's important to reflect on your attitude towards work or study. \"Pain is not just about muscles, it's emotional and psychological,\" explains Dr Xand. He says that previously people would be told to focus on their desk set-up without taking into account that pain can be a result of \"stress, the amount of time you're doing your job and whether you do any exercise.\" \"Your seat height is important but other facts are also important,\" he adds. So, sometimes fixing your posture is as much about easing your schedule as it is about stretching your spine. In some cases poor posture (not just back pain) can be down to an underlying medical condition and you should check in with your GP if concerned. According to the NHS, if you're suffering from back pain you should try and stay active, take anti-inflammatory medicines and try doing some exercises and stretches. You should see a GP if your back pain doesn't improve after treating it at home for a few weeks or the pain is getting worse over time. Morning Live will be back on air on Monday 1st September.

    "text": "Will Serena Williams's weight-loss admission help shed stigma of anti-obesity drugs?. Serena Williams, one of the most successful athletes of all time, has spoken out about using weight loss drugs - she says, to lift the \"stigma\" around using such medication. Will her outspoken comments instil a new sense of confidence in those using the drugs? And could her honesty quieten the critics? The 43-year-old tennis star, who broke records and won 23 grand slam titles through her career, was the embodiment of fitness and athletic prowess. But, after having kids, even she, like so many of us, has admitted to struggling to shift those extra pounds. In the end, Williams told the Today Show on TV in the US, that she had to look at her extra weight as \"an opponent\". Despite \"training five hours a day\" and \"running, walking, biking, stair climbing,\" she couldn't pulverise this adversary like she did to her opponents on the tennis court - so in the end, she says, she had no other choice but to \"try something different\". Many of her friends were using GLP-1 - the group of medications which help with weight loss, so she decided to try it. Williams is adamant that the medication route - she won't say which brand she is taking - wasn't easy, and certainly not a shortcut to her losing 31lb (14kg) over the past eight months. There is scepticism about the timing of the tennis star's recent transparency - she has just become a spokesperson for Ro, a company which sells GLP-1 brands like Wegovy and Zepbound (known as Mounjaro in the UK) through its weight-loss programme, and her husband is also an investor. Despite this and the potential side effects of taking the medication, her honesty will hit a nerve for many - she says she is speaking out to take away the shame that so many women feel when it comes to using drugs to help them lose weight. Caleb Luna, assistant professor of feminist studies at the University of California, says having someone like Serena Williams speaking out is \"a breakthrough\". They say it helps silence the critics of how \"weight loss is achieved\" who say that \"people are taking the easy way out\" by using weight loss drugs. \"It gets rid of the stereotype that these drugs are for fat people who are being lazy and incompetent. \"In that respect it's maybe a good thing.\" But Caleb also says the revelation about her need to resort to using GLP-1 medication is slightly \"terrifying\" and makes them feel \"a little bit sad\". They worry that all it does is belittle hard work and dedication, instead, focussing on appearance and the pressure to look a certain way. \"She has achieved things that so few people, in our time and throughout history have achieved. \"But now it just shows how all those accomplishments can be undermined by body size. \"Scarily, weight loss seems to outshine all those record-breaking achievements.\" Williams's weight and her looks have been scrutinised throughout her life. The burden, the pressure to fit in with society's expectations does not diminish no matter how much sporting success an athlete has in their career. And while she may be the most high profile sports star who openly uses weight loss medication, there are many others in the public eye who have spoken out. Oprah Winfrey says she uses GLP-1 as a tool, along with exercise and healthy eating, to stop herself \"yo-yoing\" with her weight. Actress Whoopi Goldberg says she lost the weight of \"two people\" after taking the drug, and singer Kelly Clarkson, who says she was \"chased\" by her \"doctor for two years\" before she agreed to take it, are among the dozens of stars who have been open about taking the medication. Williams left the world of tennis behind back in 2022, when she played the final match of her career in the US Open, but she is still a powerhouse of strength and has wanted to reach what she describes as her \"healthy weight\" since the birth of her second child, Adira. In her interview with the Today Show, says she felt like her \"body was missing something\" and she wasn't able to get down to what she felt comfortable with - despite intense training. Dr Claire Madigan, a senior research associate in behavioural medicine at the School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences at Loughborough University, says elite athletes can find it hard to lose weight. \"They are used to consuming a lot of calories and when they leave the sport they can find it difficult - it needs a change in behaviour.\" Dr Madigan said  it was good to see that Williams mentioned her weight loss was not just down to the drug - \"she did have to focus on the diet and physical activity\". She added: \"It's great she is talking about how difficult it is to lose weight after having a baby.\" But she wonders if Williams's message might be lost and even demotivate some women.  \"The drugs are quite expensive and the average person may think here is an elite athlete, she's got access to the gym, she's got time, she has a nutritionist… and she's had to use GLP-1s\". Dr Madigan also expressed concern that the potential side effects of taking the drugs - which can include gastrointestinal problems like vomiting and diarrhoea, and in rare cases, gallbladder and kidney problems - may not have been widely discussed in the publicity surrounding Williams's announcement. Williams says she did not experience any side effects, and told Women's Health magazine that she is finally seeing the benefits of all her hard work at the gym. \"My joints are a lot better,\" she says, \"I just had my check-up, and the doctor said everything - including my blood sugar levels - looked great.\" And, even though, she's no longer breaking new ground on the tennis courts, she is still smashing her own records, with the help, she says of weight loss drugs. She's currently training for a half marathon. \"I am running farther than I ever have,\" she says proudly. Additional reporting by Alex Kleiderman Morgan Betchley was \"brutalised\" by Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, her mother-in-law says. More than 2,000 NHS patients have been treated with UK-donated blood plasma since a ban was lifted.

    "text": "Lucy Letby's new expert supporters claim no babies were deliberately harmed. Who should we believe?. Listen to Jonathan read this article. When it comes to the Lucy Letby case, there are two parallel universes. In one, the question of her guilt is settled. She is a monster who murdered seven babies and attempted to murder seven more while she was a nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital between 2015 and 2016. In the other universe, Letby is the victim of a flawed criminal justice system in which unreliable medical evidence was used to condemn and imprison an innocent woman. This is what Letby's barrister Mark McDonald argues. He says he has the backing of a panel of the best experts in the world who say there is no evidence any babies were deliberately harmed. These extremes are both disturbing and bewildering. One of them is wrong - but which? Who should we believe? The families of the infants say there is no doubt. Letby was convicted after a 10-month trial by a jury that had considered a vast range of evidence. They say Letby's defenders are picking on small bits of evidence out of context and that the constant questioning of her guilt is deeply distressing. I have spent almost three years investigating the Letby case - in that time I have made three Panorama documentaries and cowritten a book on the subject with my colleague Judith Moritz. Yet, if true, the new evidence, presented by Mark McDonald in a series of high-profile press conferences and media releases, is shocking. According to his experts, the prosecution expert medical case is unreliable. Mark McDonald has not released the panel's full reports, which are currently with the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the body he needs to persuade to reopen Letby's case, but he has released summaries of the panel's findings. Letby was found guilty of 15 counts of murder and attempted murder, and the jury in her original trial reached unanimous verdicts on three of those cases. That is a good indication of where the strongest medical evidence might lie. To get a sense of the imperfections woven through both the prosecution and the defence arguments, it's worth looking at one of those cases in which the guilty verdict was unanimous: that of Baby O. Baby O was born in June 2016, one of triplet brothers. At Letby's trial, the jury was told that his death was in part the result of liver injuries, which the prosecution pathologist described as impact-type injuries - similar to those in a car accident. As in other cases for which Letby was convicted, the prosecution said circumstantial evidence also tied her to the crime. However, a paediatric pathologist who was not involved in the case but has seen Baby O's post-mortem report, says it was \"unlikely\" Baby O's liver injuries were caused by impact - as the prosecution claims. \"You can't completely rule out the possibility,\" says the pathologist, who does not want to be identified. \"But in my view, the location of the injuries and the condition of the liver tissue itself don't fit with that explanation.\" Which raises the obvious question - if the prosecution were wrong about Baby O's liver injuries, then why did he die? Letby was accused of injecting air into the blood of Baby O as well as that of other babies. This, the prosecution said, caused an air bubble and a blockage in the circulation known as air embolism. During the trial the prosecution pointed to several pieces of evidence to make their case, including a 1989 academic study of air embolism in newborn babies, which noted skin discolouration as one possible feature of it. Prosecutors argued that these same skin colour changes were observed in several babies in the Letby case. However, Dr Shoo Lee, a Canadian neonatologist and one of the authors of that 1989 study, is now part of Letby's team of defence experts working with Mark McDonald. He argues that his study was misused. He says skin discolouration has not featured in any reported cases of air embolism in babies where the air has entered the circulation via a vein – which is what the prosecution alleged happened in the Letby case. In other words, the prosecution was wrong to use skin discolouration as evidence of air embolism. It sounds significant. But is it enough to defeat the air embolism allegations? As with many aspects of the Letby case, the answer is not clear-cut. The prosecution did not rely on skin discolouration alone to make their case for air embolism. And although there have not been any reported cases of skin discolouration in babies where air has entered the circulation via a vein, some critics have argued that the number of reported air embolism cases is small and that the theory is still possible. To muddy the waters further, another of Mark McDonald's panel of experts has said that in fact there was post-mortem evidence of air embolism in the babies. \"We know these babies suffered air embolism because of the post-mortem imaging in some of them,\" says Neena Modi, a professor of neonatal medicine. She believes this is highly likely to have occurred during resuscitation, and that there are much more plausible explanations for the collapses and deaths of the babies in the Letby case than air embolism. The air embolism theory, she said, was \"highly speculative\". But her remarks show the debate is far from settled. There has been another explanation for Baby O's death. In December 2024, Mark McDonald called a press conference in which one of his experts, Dr Richard Taylor, claimed that a doctor had accidentally pierced the baby's liver with a needle during resuscitation. This, he argued, had led to the baby's death. Dr Taylor added: \"I think the doctor knows who they are. I have to say from a personal point of view that if this had happened to me, I'd be unable to sleep at night knowing that what I had done had led to the death of a baby, and now there is a nurse in jail, convicted of murder.\" The doctor accused of causing the baby's death was subsequently identified as Stephen Brearey – one of Letby's principal accusers at the Countess of Chester Hospital. Mr Brearey says: \"Given the ongoing investigations and inquiries, and to respect the confidentiality of those involved, I will not be making any further comment at this time.\" It was a bombshell claim. But does the evidence support it? One indication that the needle theory might be shaky was that Dr Taylor, by his own admission, had not seen Baby O's medical notes and was relying on a report that had been written by two other experts. Another obvious problem with the needle theory is that it had already been examined at length during Letby's trial. The prosecution pathologist concluded that there was no evidence that a needle had pierced Baby O's liver while he was alive and the paediatric pathologist we spoke to agrees. They told us: \"These injuries weren't caused by a needle. They were in different parts of the liver and there was no sign of any needle injury on the liver.\" Even if the needle had penetrated the baby's liver, it cannot explain why Baby O collapsed in the first place or why he died - the needle was inserted after the baby's final and fatal collapse towards the end of the resuscitation. When asked if he still stood by his comments about the doctor's needle, Dr Taylor told us that while the needle may not have been the primary cause of death, his \"opinion has not substantially changed\". He said the \"needle probably penetrated the liver\" of Baby O, and \"probably accelerated his demise\". The question of where this leaves the case presented by Mark McDonald's panel of experts when it comes to the needle theory is a difficult one to answer. It would appear that among the experts working with Letby's defence, there is not consensus. Consultant neonatologist Dr Neil Aiton is one of the authors of the original report on which Dr Taylor based his comments. Dr Aiton says that he has examined the evidence independently and has concluded that Baby O's liver injuries were caused by inappropriate resuscitation attempts, including hyperinflation of the baby's lungs. However, he also says it was \"pretty clear\" a needle had punctured the liver during resuscitation. When Dr Aiton was told that other experts, including the paediatric pathologist who spoke to the BBC, have examined the case of Baby O and said that it is implausible to conclude this happened, he said that there were two possibilities. Either the liver ruptured because of a needle or it ruptured spontaneously. Dr Aiton's position appears to be that poor resuscitation caused the baby's liver injuries and whether the rupturing was caused by a needle or not is \"not important\". That is a contrast from what Dr Taylor said in that December press conference. And critics say Dr Aiton's account still does not explain why Baby O collapsed in the first place and why he needed such desperate resuscitation. A summary report from Letby's expert panel appears to back further away from the needle theory. It says a needle \"may have\" punctured the liver. Other experts, including the paediatric pathologist, said that Dr Aiton's observation of hyper-inflated lungs would not explain Baby O's liver injuries. Once again, the case illustrates how difficult it is to distinguish between plausible and implausible claims. Since that press conference, other experts working for Letby's defence team have put forward another theory for Baby O's death. They say his liver injuries were the result of traumatic delivery at the time of birth. Professor Modi says this was a \"highly plausible cause\". But that has been contested from a surprising direction. Dr Mike Hall, a neonatologist, was Lucy Letby's original defence expert and attended court throughout her trial. He has been a staunch critic of her conviction, arguing her trial wasn't fair and that there is no definitive medical evidence that babies were deliberately harmed. However, Dr Hall's view is that evidence for the birth trauma theory is simply not there. He notes that Baby O was born in good condition by caesarean section and there is no record of a traumatic delivery in the baby's medical notes. \"There's still no evidence that anyone did anything deliberately to harm Baby O,\" he adds. \"However, something was going on with Baby O, which we haven't explained. \"We don't know what the cause of this is. But that doesn't mean that we therefore have to pretend that we know.\" For the jury, Baby O was one of the clearest cases that proved Letby was a killer. And yet there appears to be flawed expert evidence on both sides. There were two other cases where the jury returned unanimous verdicts – the cases of Babies F and L. The prosecution argued that both babies had been poisoned with insulin and highlighted blood tests that it said were clear evidence of this. For the prosecution, the insulin cases proved that someone at the Countess of Chester Hospital was harming babies. Letby's defence have, meanwhile, marshalled numerous arguments against the insulin theory. One is that the blood test used - an immunoassay - is inaccurate and should have been verified. But even Letby's experts accept the test is accurate around 98% of the time. Another argument is that premature babies can process insulin differently and that the blood test results are \"within the expected range for pre-term infants\". But the medical specialists we've spoken to are baffled by this claim and say it goes against mainstream scientific understanding. Of course, mainstream opinion can be wrong. But it is difficult to tell because Letby's defence team have not shared the scientific evidence. One of the experts behind the report – a mechanical engineer who carries out biomedical research – clarified that his analysis says the blood test results were \"not uncommon\". However, Letby's defence declined to show the BBC the published studies that support this claim. Once again, the claims of both the prosecution and defence are not clear-cut. Ultimately, the question of whether Letby's case should be re-examined by the Court of Appeal now lies with CCRC. They have the task of studying Mark McDonald's expert reports. If he is successful and Lucy Letby's case is referred back to the Court of Appeal - that is ultimately where the expert evidence on both sides will face a true reckoning. Lead image credit: Cheshire Constabulary, PA Clarification 19 August: This article was amended to make clear that in mentioning Letby's defenders we were referring to those experts working with her defence team. We've also added some context to our reporting of Dr Aiton's position regarding whether a needle played any part in the baby's liver injuries. The medic wins a High Court case over a NHS trust investigation into what he knew about the nurse. The criminal investigation into the neonatal nurse has been continuing behind the scenes. The Crown Prosecution Service is considering a \"full file\" of evidence submitted by Cheshire Police. All three worked at the Countess of Chester Hospital when the nurse killed babies at its neonatal unit. The Conservative MP said \"credible\" questions had been raised by experts about the nurse's crimes. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

    "text": "Drinks that make you chill - do they really do what it says on the tin?. Calm in a can. Relaxation after a few sips. That's what some drinks companies are promising with beverages formulated specifically to help you chill out. Lucy and Serena swear by them. They're good friends who, like many, are juggling careers,  the chaos of having small children, trying to stay fit, and everything else in between. \"These drinks aren't going to get rid of all my worries and anxieties,\" Serena says, \"but if they give me a little boost - then I'll take it.\" Lucy finds them really useful too, especially when she's feeling a bit overwhelmed. \"If I get that low-level panic, then with a drink of Trip or something like it, I can bring it back round.\" But after an advert by one of the industry's best-known brands was banned for suggesting its drinks helped with stress and anxiety, there have been questions about whether drinks of this kind are quite as effective as they make out. BBC News has spoken to nutritionists and dietitians who are sceptical the small amounts of supplements the drinks contain could really bring about that sense of zen. One psychologist has suggested that we might actually \"create our own calm\" when we set aside time for ourselves with something that feels like a treat. The \"functional beverage\" market - that's drinks with additional health benefits - is booming, with British supermarkets seeing sales jump by 24.5% in the last 12 months, according to one market research firm. Almost 30% of UK households now buy these functional drinks, Worldpanel by Numerator says. So, what's actually in them that's supposed to help you feel more mellow or give your health a boost? Well, that's where things can get complicated, as each brand takes a different approach. Along with Trip's Mindful Blend, other companies like Rheal, Grass&Co, Goodrays and supermarket own-brands, advertise that their drinks contain supplements including: These supplements are all commonly found in many health and wellbeing products and are associated with enhancing mood, boosting energy, supporting cognition, and helping with stress. But how robust is the evidence for that? It's tricky because there are many studies of varying credibility each suggesting different levels of efficacy. Trip's advert, which suggested its ingredients were stress and anxiety busters, breached the Advertising Standards Agency's (ASA) code, with the ASA ruling that Trip's claims their drinks could \"prevent, treat or cure disease\" were a step too far. Trip told BBC News the ruling related to \"a single page on the website\" and it has made the \"changes requested\". It says it's confident its ingredients permit the use of the word \"calm\" which is \"widely and lawfully used by many brands\". Dietitian Reema Patel is concerned the amount of supplement in these drinks may not give consumers the emotional balance, feelings of calm, or stress relief that is advertised across the industry. She highlights a growing body of evidence around the funghi Lion's Mane, but says there are no conclusive findings about whether it can have any impact - as yet. \"The research is still very much in its infancy,\" she says. \"In one of the more advanced clinical trials, a small number of participants were given 1800mg  - that's at least four times more than what is in some of these drinks.\" Studies suggest women are more likely to consume these kinds of supplements, but they're not always front and centre in the research. The lack of research that includes female participants is partly down to menstrual cycles and fluctuating hormones, making it more \"complicated to track\", Ms Patel explains. But these drinks can make a good alternative to drinking alcohol she says, and she has clients who have made the switch from having a wine or a gin and tonic every night to opening a can of one of these drinks to help them unwind. \"I think you can take a lot of the claims with a pinch of salt, but they are definitely giving people that other option.\" Dr Sinead Roberts, a performance nutritionist, says supplements can make a difference, but they tend to work for certain groups of people in specific circumstances - such as high-performing athletes who want that extra edge, or people who are deficient in a certain nutrient - not necessarily for the general population. If you enjoy the taste, \"crack on\", Dr Roberts says, but if you want to reduce stress and anxiety you're probably best saving your £2 or £3 and putting it towards a \"therapy session or a massage at the end of the month\". \"A trace of Lion's Mane or Ashgawanda in a fizzy drink is not going to make any difference,\" she adds. Emily May, 25, first discovered these drinks at Glastonbury a couple of years ago. She's not overly bothered about trying to reach a state of zen through them - she just likes the taste. \"I'm ADHD,\" Emily says, \"so I would definitely need a lot more than one of those drinks to calm me down.\" There is a fine line between advertising that a product will give you a feeling of calm and quiet, and claiming these kinds of drinks will help with mental health problems. Psychologist Natasha Tiwari says mental health and well-being are \"increasingly conflated\" in the wellness sector, creating a \"toxic mix\". There can be a positive - yet temporary - change in mood and consumers might feel a buzz, she says, not because of the ingredients necessarily, but because \"everything around the experience of the product is real\". \"So you've bought a drink which, let's say, is a little bit pricier than the alternatives in the market. Therefore you make a commitment to sit down quietly and enjoy it nicely,\" she says. \"You look at the branding - which is lovely and calming - you're processing your environment in the moment, and then actually what you're experiencing truly is a calm moment in your otherwise busy day. That's not fake.\" And it's that little window of peace that Lucy and Serena yearn for - and for a few minutes a fizzy drink in a can gives them that, whether the science really agrees, or not. BBC News contacted all the brands mentioned in this article. Grass&Co told us it's their mission \"to deliver high-strength natural adaptogen and vitamin-packed blends formulated by experts... which are supported by approved health claims.\" Goodrays said it wasn't \"offering a panacea\", but that it was \"certainly offering a healthier alternative\" with the \"best efficacy possible\".

    "text": "A walk-in fishermen's clinic saved Tom from sepsis - and could transform the NHS. Tom Parker was working alone three miles (4.8km) off the Devon coast when his fishing boat hit a wave and lurched to one side. \"I was pulling one of the ropes and I slipped and fell,\" he says. \"I had this really, really bad pain in my ankle. So much so, I couldn't get up off the floor.\" He didn't know it at the time, but Tom, 37, had broken his fibula and badly damaged his ankle ligaments. He somehow hauled in his fishing gear and made it to hospital to get patched up, but months after the accident his wound just wouldn't heal properly. It was only after he turned up at an innovative clinic on the quayside in Brixham that he was put on strong antibiotics and told he needed a second operation. \"Without that service, I would have probably ended up with my leg turning septic and I'm not too sure what would have happened after that,\" he says. Under a 10-year plan, published last month, health officials said the NHS in England needed to undergo a radical shift, away from hospitals to community care, and away from treating sickness to preventing it in the first place. There are already small-scale examples of that approach in action across the country. So what can we learn from the Brixham model and how can the idea of targeted, local care be extended to treat millions more NHS patients? On a clear summer morning a spare room in the trawler agent's offices in Brixham harbour is quickly being converted into a temporary health clinic. Blue screens are dragged across to split up the space: a makeshift reception at the front and then just enough room to cram in two GPs, a pharmacist, a physiotherapist, two nurses and someone organising prostate cancer tests. There's a steady line of port workers coming in, from buyers in the fish market next door to crews from the trawlers in the harbour. \"The skippers of the boats and the whole fishing community now know exactly where to find us,\" says Dr James Gunning, the local NHS GP in charge of the clinic that day. \"They're a community that fits into health inequalities, where a population either can't access, or struggles to access, normal NHS services.\" Staff working on the project start early in the morning, walking around the docks and coaxing workers off the boats with promises of free health screenings and physio. \"Fishermen don't have nine-to-five jobs, they don't have lunchtime where they can just pop off their fishing boat and to the GP's office, and so it's really important that we take those services to them,\" says Sandra Welch, chief executive of the Seafarers Hospital Society, which runs the initiative along with another charity, the Fishermen's Mission. A pop-up Seafit clinic operates every three months in Brixham and at similar sites at ports across the UK, including Folkestone, Peterhead and Kilkeel in Northern Ireland. Some services have started to expand and now offer skin cancer checks, mobile dental services and access to mental health counselling. In its 10-year plan the NHS accepts that those who live in coastal and rural areas are more likely to experience worse health outcomes and to die younger. Seaside and coastal towns often have older populations with more complex health needs, while at the same time local NHS services can suffer from recruitment problems, leaving staffing gaps where they are needed most. An analysis of hospital statistics by the BBC suggests NHS trusts in England treating coastal communities tend to have higher than average wait times for both emergency care and appointments booked in advance, like surgery. The answer, according to NHS bosses and the Westminster government, is to shift as much treatment as possible out of those expensive hospitals. Under the 10-year plan a network of 300 neighbourhood health centres will be opened across England, starting in areas with the lowest healthy life expectancy. The sites, which should eventually be open 12 hours a day, six days a week, will be staffed by a mix of GPs, nurses, social care workers, pharmacists, mental health specialists and other medics. The big idea, as with the Brixham fishermen's clinic, is to better tailor health services to local communities, and offer people more checks and tests to stop them falling sick in the first place. Much of this might feel very familiar. Similar ambitions were set out by ministers in 2019, 2015 and even by the Blair government back in the early 2000s. \"Despite being the right aim, none of those truly delivered,\" says Luisa Pettigrew, a GP and senior policy fellow at the Health Foundation think tank. \"Moving money out of hospitals and into community services is hard to do. You need the upfront investment and the results might not be visible for five or 10 years, in some cases longer.\" Healthcare unions have also questioned how the new centres will be staffed, saying doctors \"must not be moved around like pieces on a chess board or made to work even harder\". The medics working in Brixham though are convinced their local, preventative approach can benefit not just the fishing community but the wider health service. \"We've managed to find new diabetic patients who otherwise may have gone on to develop more serious disease,\" says Dr Gunning. \"We've picked out others with cardiovascular disease, and those with high blood pressure. So we would certainly hope we can prevent more costly illness from developing.\" Rob Caunter, who finally retired from the fish market this year, is just finishing his radiotherapy treatment for prostate cancer. The 66-year-old, who has a family history of the disease, was diagnosed after staff at the clinic convinced him to take a blood test. \"I was gobsmacked really because I didn't think there was anything wrong with me,\" he says. \"If I never went for the checks, I don't think I would be here today. So it was a real godsend for them to come down to the quay.\" Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. Sign up here.

    "text": "Could RFK Jr's move to pull mRNA vaccine funding be a huge miscalculation?. mRNA vaccines were heralded as a medical marvel that saved lives during the Covid pandemic, but now the US is pulling back from researching them. US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr has cancelled 22 projects - worth $500m (£376m) in funding – for tackling infections such as Covid and flu. So does Kennedy - probably the country's most famous vaccine sceptic – have a point, or is he making a monumental miscalculation? Prof Adam Finn, vaccine researcher at the University of Bristol, says \"it's a bit of both\" but ditching mRNA technology is \"stupid\" and potentially a \"catastrophic error\". Let's unpick why. Kennedy says he has reviewed the science on mRNA vaccines, concluding that the \"data show these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu\". Instead, he says, he would shift funding to \"safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate\". So are mRNA vaccines safe? Are they effective? Would other vaccine technologies be better? And another question is where should mRNA vaccines fit into the pantheon of other vaccine technologies - because there are many: Each has advantages and disadvantages, but Prof Finn argues we \"overhyped\" mRNA vaccines during the pandemic to the exclusion of other approaches, and now there is a process of adjusting. \"But to swing the pendulum so far that mRNA is useless and has no value and should not be developed or understood better is equally stupid, it did do remarkable things,\" he says.  The claim that mRNA vaccines do not protect against upper respiratory infections like Covid and flu \"just isn't true\", says Prof Andrew Pollard from the Oxford Vaccine Group, who is soon stepping down as the head of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which advises the UK government. The vaccines were shown to provide protection – keeping people alive and out of hospital – in both clinical trials and then during intense monitoring of how the vaccines performed when they were rolled out around the world. In the first year of vaccination during the Covid pandemic, it was estimated that the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine alone saved nearly 6 million lives. Against that there were a small number of cases of inflammation of heart tissue – called myocarditis – particularly in young men. \"Very rare side effects should be balanced against the huge benefit of the technology,\" says Prof Pollard. The pandemic was an era when the world was single-mindedly focused on Covid and the rollout of vaccines was monitored intensely. The consensus opinion remains they did overwhelmingly more good than harm. But that does not mean they are a perfect technology. The mRNA Covid vaccines train the immune system to target just one protein out of the whole virus. If that protein in the coronavirus changes or mutates then the body's protection is lessened. We have seen the consequences of that – immunity wanes and the vaccines need to be updated. One theoretical argument is that a different vaccine approach – such as using the whole virus – would give better protection, as the immune system would have more to target. However, Prof Pollard says the mRNA vaccines performed better than the inactivated ones when tackling Covid. He says that is probably down to the way they are made - and the fact that the process of killing the virus also \"changes the viral proteins so there is less stimulation of the immune system\" in comparison with mRNA vaccines. The need to update vaccines is not a failing of mRNA technology that can be easily solved by pivoting from one technology to another - instead, it is down to the fundamental nature of some viruses. The same measles or HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccines have been effective for decades and show no sign of failing as the virus's genetic codes are more stable in each case. But some viruses live in a perpetual state of flux. Flu, for example, is not one virus - but instead a constantly-shifting target. At any time, one strain will be in the ascendancy and be the most likely to cause trouble in winter. In flu, the inactivated flu injection that is given to adults is updated every year - as is the live vaccine that is given to children as a nasal spray. A future mRNA form of flu vaccine would work the same way. \"The point about keeping up with variants is about all technologies, not just mRNA,\" says Prof Pollard.  There is a legitimate scientific question about which vaccine technology is used for which disease. What is causing concern among scientists is that pulling mRNA research means we will not have those vaccines at times when we need to do what no other technology can. Prof Pollard says: \"I don't think there's the evidence they are hugely better for protection, but where RNA tech is streets ahead of everything else is responding to outbreaks.\" The world is highly drilled at making new flu vaccines each year. But even then, there is a six-month process of deciding on the new flu strains to be targeted, growing the vaccine at scale in chicken eggs and then distributing it. Brand new vaccines take even longer. But with mRNA, you can have the new vaccine in six to eight weeks, and then tens or hundreds of millions of doses a few months later. Some of the projects that have had their funding pulled in the US were preparing for a bird flu pandemic. That virus, H5N1, has been devastating bird populations and jumping into a wide range of other animals including American cattle. \"That doesn't make sense and if we do get a human pandemic of bird flu it could be seen as a catastrophic error,\" says Prof Finn. But the ramifications of the US turning away from mRNA research could be felt more widely. What impact does this move have on confidence in the current vaccines, mRNA or otherwise? How does it affect the world when the US is one of the most influential countries in medical research? And will it have a knock-on impact on other types of mRNA technology, such as cancer vaccines - or using the approach to treat rare genetic diseases? Prof Pollard poses another question after RFK Jr's move: \"Does it put us all at risk if a huge market is turning its back on RNA? \"It is one of the most important technologies we'll see this century in infectious disease, biotherapeutic agents for rare disease and critically for cancer. It's a message I'm troubled about.\" The deployment of the National Guard to Memphis comes roughly a month after he sent troops to Washington DC. \"We got him,\" Utah Governor Spencer Cox said after authorities apprehended Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspected of killing the conservative activist. The FBI says a family member recognised the 22-year-old man from Utah from surveillance images released to the public. Kirk's loyalty towards the first family put him at the very centre of Donald Trump's Maga movement. The governor said a family member told investigators that the suspect had become \"more political\" in recent years. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

    "text": "Why we need to talk about periods, breasts and injuries in women's sport. The Euros are reaching their conclusion in a massive summer across women's sport. But away from the drama and excitement on the pitch, there is also a scientific revolution taking place. Teams of scientists are researching the unique ways that elite sport affects the female body – how breasts alter the way you run, but the right sports bra could give you the edge; how the menstrual cycle could impact performance and what role period trackers could play; and why is there a higher risk of some injuries, and what can be done to avoid them? It's a far cry from the era when professional female athletes told me they were thought of simply as \"mini-men\". Cast your mind back to the iconic scene from the final of the last European Championships in 2022. It was extra time at Wembley and Lioness Chloe Kelly scored the winning goal against Germany. In the ensuing euphoria, she whipped off her England shirt showing the world her sports bra. It was fitted by Prof Joanna Wakefield-Scurr, from the University of Portsmouth, who proudly goes by the nickname the Bra Professor. Here are her breast facts: Laboratory experiments – using motion sensors on the chest – have revealed how a shifting mass of breast tissue alters the movement of the rest of the body, and in turn, sporting performance. \"For some women, their breasts can be really quite heavy and if that weight moves, it can change the movement of your torso, it can even change the amount of force that you exert on the ground,\" Prof Wakefield-Scurr tells me. Compensating for bouncing breasts by restricting the movement of your upper body alters the positioning of the pelvis and shortens the length of each stride. That's why sports bras are not just for comfort or fashion, but a piece of performance gear. \"We actually saw that low breast support meant a reduction in stride length of four centimetres,\" Prof Wakefield-Scurr explains. \"If you lost four centimetres every step in a marathon, it adds up to a mile.\" Sports bras also protect the delicate structures inside the breast, \"if we stretch them, that's permanent,\" the professor says, so \"it's about prevention rather than cure\". The menstrual cycle has a clear impact on the body – it can affect emotions, mood and sleep as well as cause fatigue, headache and cramps. But Calli Hauger-Thackery, a distance runner who has represented Team GB at the Olympics, says talking about its sporting impact is \"still so taboo and it shouldn't be, because we're struggling with it\". Calli says she always notices the difference in her body in the lead up to her period. \"I'm feeling really fatigued, heavy legs, I [feel like I'm] almost running through mud sometimes, everything's more strained than it should be,\" she says. Calli finds she \"lives\" by her menstruation tracker, as being on her period is a source of anxiety \"especially when I've got big races coming up\". One of those big races was in April – the Boston Marathon – and Calli's period was due. She finished in sixth place, and recalls that she \"luckily got through\" - but says she can't help wondering if she could have done even better. The menstrual cycle is orchestrated by the rhythmic fluctuations of two hormones – oestrogen and progesterone. But how big an impact can that have on athletic performance? \"It's very individual and there's a lot of nuance here, it's not quite as simple as saying the menstrual cycle affects performance,\" says Prof Kirsty Elliott-Sale, who specialises in female endocrinology and exercise physiology at Manchester Metropolitan University. \"Competitions, personal bests, world records, everything has been set, won and lost on every day of the menstrual cycle,\" she says. This famously includes Paula Radcliffe, who broke the marathon world record while running through period cramps in Chicago in 2002. Working out whether the menstrual cycle affects sporting ability requires an understanding of the physiological changes that hormones have throughout the body, the challenge of performing while experiencing symptoms, the psychological impact of the anxiety of competing during your period and perceptions about all of the above. Prof Elliott-Sale says there \"isn't a phase where you're stronger or weaker\", or where \"you're going to win or you're going to lose\", but in theory the hormones oestrogen and progesterone could alter parts of the body such as bone, muscle or heart. \"What we don't yet understand is: Does that have a big enough effect to really impact performance?\" she says. The professor adds that it is \"a very sensible conclusion\" that poor sleep, fatigue and cramping would have a knock-on effect on performance, and that dread and anxiety were an \"absolutely tangible thing\" for athletes on their period who are performing in front of large crowds. She has spoken to athletes who \"sometimes even triple up with period pants\" to avoid the risk of leaking and embarrassment, and \"that's a heavy mental burden\". Rugby union team, Sale Sharks Women have been working with Manchester Metropolitan University. I met Katy Daley-McLean, former England rugby captain and England all-time leading point scorer. The team are having open discussions around periods to help them understand the impact that menstruation can have, and how to plan for it. This includes taking ibuprofen three days before, rather than thinking: \"I can't do anything about it,\" Daley-McLean says. \"It's through that knowledge and that information that we can talk about this, we can put plans in place, and we can change our behaviour to make you a better rugby player,\" she says. One issue that has emerged as women's sport has been given more attention is a difference in the susceptibility to some injuries. Most of the attention has been around the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) – a part of the knee that attaches the upper and lower parts of the leg together. Injuries can be brutal and take a year to recover from. Not only is the risk three to eight times greater in women than men, depending on the sport, but they are becoming more common, says Dr Thomas Dos'Santos, a sports biomechanics researcher at Manchester Metropolitan University. However, there is \"no simple answer\" to explain the greater risk in women, he says. Partly it could be down to differences in anatomy. Bigger hips in women mean the top of the thigh bone starts from a wider position and this changes the angle it connects to the lower leg at the knee, potentially increasing risk. The ACL is also slightly smaller in women \"so it's a little bit weaker, potentially\", Dr Dos'Santos explains. ACL injuries can happen at all stages of the menstrual cycle, but hormonal changes are also being investigated, including a study sponsored by Fifa, the governing body for world football. High levels of oestrogen prior to ovulation could alter the properties of ligaments, making them a bit more stretchy so \"there could be an increased risk of injury, theoretically,\" he says. But Dr Dos'Santos argues it's important to think beyond pure anatomy as women still do not get the same quality of support and strength training as men. He compares it to ballet, where dancers do receive good quality training. \"The [difference in] incidence rates is basically trivial between men and women,\" Dr Dos'Santos says. There is research into whether it is possible to minimise the risk of ACL injuries, by training female athletes to move in subtly different ways. But there is a risk of lessening performance, and some techniques that put strain on the ACL – like dropping the shoulder to deceive a defender before bursting off in another direction – are the necessary moves in sports like football. \"We can't wrap them up in cotton wool and say you should avoid playing sport,\" Dr Dos'Santos says. \"What we need to do is make sure that they're strong enough to tolerate those loads, but it isn't just as simple as some people saying we can 100% eradicate ACL injuries, we can't.\" Even though there are still many unanswered question, it is still a world of difference for Katy Daley-McLean at Sale Sharks Women. When she got her first cap in 2007, she remembers that all the assumptions around how her body would perform were based on the data from male rugby players. \"We were literally treated as mini-men,\" Daley-McLean recalls. And now, she says, girls and women don't feel like the outsiders in sport, which is not only improving performance at the elite level but helping to keep more women in sport. \"It's awesome, it's something to be celebrated because if you look at the stats, one of the biggest reasons young girls drop out of sport is body image, it's around periods and not having a correct sports bra, which is so easily sorted.\" Inside Health was produced by Gerry Holt Morgan Betchley was \"brutalised\" by Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, her mother-in-law says.

    "text": "Students feel 'let down' by mental health support - but should it really be up to universities?. Listen to Joe read this article When Imogen arrived at the University of Nottingham in September 2022, she carried with her a letter addressed to the student wellbeing services. As a teenager, she struggled with anxiety and self-harm. The letter, written by her former head of year, was a direct plea to the university to help her. Three years on, Imogen (not her real name) feels let down. She has since been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism, and was referred for university counselling multiple times, but, instead of helping, she says it made her feel worse. \"I felt like I was being thrown between services, no-one wanted me and no-one could help me.\" Another student at Nottingham, Leacsaidh, who was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) at age 17, characterises the services as \"one-size-fits-all\". She says that when she sought help for self-harm, she was simply given website references. The University of Nottingham is certainly not an outlier, nor is it considered worse than other British universities for mental health support. Jana, an international student at King's College London (KCL), was diagnosed with anxiety by a university GP, which made her eligible for certain adjustments, but she found the process of implementing them \"painful\". Requests for deadline extensions, she says, were delayed by clerical errors, compounding her anxiety at an already stressful time. A King's College London spokesperson said: \"The wellbeing of our students is our top priority and we are continually making improvements to our services, which includes streamlining processes for approving adjustments for students with disabilities and wherever possible, removing barriers.\" Given that the number of young people reporting mental health concerns is rising, these sorts of issues could get worse. For its part, the University of Nottingham says it has invested in its specialist wellbeing services in recent years. A spokesperson says they \"encourage any student with concerns to discuss their experiences with us\". However, they also stress: \"University services are there to support the mental health and wellbeing of our students but are not a replacement for clinical NHS services to treat more serious or complex needs.\" Which raises the question: are institutions really letting students down - or is the expectation placed on them part of the issue? And to what extent should the responsibility fall on universities in the first place? The extent of the crisis in student mental health came to public attention in 2018 after Natasha Abrahart, a physics student at the University of Bristol, killed herself. Ten others are believed to have taken their own lives at the university between 2016 and 2018. In the decade to 2023-24, the number of students with a mental health condition almost quadrupled, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA), increasing every year to 2022-23 before dipping slightly in 2023-24. That year, some 122,430 students in the UK (out of a total of 2.9 million) said they had a mental health condition. Most were undergraduates, and the majority were women. Part of this may be down to age. Late adolescence (18 to 21) is what Dr Sandi Mann, a senior psychology lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire, calls the \"peak ages\" for many mental health problems, including OCD, anxiety and depression. There is no recent parallel data that directly compares the mental health of young people who do not attend university or higher education. But combining the stresses of late adolescence, academic pressure, learning how to live independently, and, for some, part-time work, creates the \"prime conditions\" for mental health issues, argues Dr Mann. A lack of \"resilience\" also concerns her. \"I'm not talking about serious mental health issues, such as severe OCD, anxiety and depression,\" she says. \"Of course they need help. But young people seem to struggle more coping with the day-to-day stresses of everyday life.\" Some have argued that society is increasingly pathologising normal experiences, and that encouraging people to talk about mental health doesn't help everyone. Ben Locke, an American psychologist who researches US colleges' support services, has argued that many mental health assessment tools cross over with normal human distress, leading to more people being told they need professional help. But Dr Sarah Sweeney, the incoming chairwoman of the student services organisation Amosshe, and head of student support and wellbeing at Lancaster University, argues that encouraging young people to talk about mental health has removed some of the stigma. She also believes, however, that more could be done to educate people about when something is a mental health challenge or problem. \"Which is different from a diagnosed mental illness,\" she stresses. Experts also point to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on mental health. Sally Lambah, head of student support and wellbeing at Wrexham University, argues that social development skills of recent university cohorts were \"stifled because they had to stay at home\". Another part of the challenge is that the first point of contact for students reporting mental health challenges is often their personal tutor - an academic. Dr Mann stresses that a personal tutor - sometimes called an academic advisor - is not a mental health practitioner. Their main role should be signposting and sometimes referring students to counselling services. One senior humanities lecturer at the University of Manchester, who asked not to be named, says that in their department, personal tutors are given a \"handbook of academic advising\" and some PowerPoint slides, which they describe as a \"series of generic questions to ask\" in specific situations. The level of training a personal tutor is given varies between universities. But often an academic's first indication of an issue is during casual conversations with a student about not submitting a piece of work on time. This can mean tutors \"don't really know that [they are] intervening in a mental health crisis\", they explain. \"And it's a problem that we're not trained for.\" They summed up the situation at universities as \"grim\". \"It has gone from being a really serious problem to being a really major crisis… People are swamped.\" The University of Manchester said that \"all student-facing staff can access a rolling programme of training on responding to mental health difficulties in students\", run by mental health nurses, and that there are \"clear and rapid\" routes to escalate cases. All academic advisors receive training and have the support of an advisor network, it said. It added that it had significantly increased investment in student health and wellbeing in the last few years. Some students argue the sheer number of services, and the levels of complexity around how to access it, can make it difficult to get the help they need. Generally, after speaking to a personal tutor, the second step for a student might be to meet with a wellbeing team, which may help them take steps to \"manage stress and the transition to university\", including advice on topics like good sleep and managing anxiety. Wellbeing advisers will typically assess whether a student's case needs escalating, and might refer students for specialist support like disability services or counselling through the university's in-house team. Students who are seriously unwell - or those who may be a risk to themselves or others - are escalated to a final step. This usually means making contact with the local health authorities about managing risk. Dr Sweeney says this can all be \"a lot\" to get your head around. \"Even as a mental health professional it's really difficult to navigate,\" adds Dr Mann. \"Nobody really knows who to go to.\" There is, at both universities and mental health services more widely, a \"real danger that people can slip through the gaps\". Universities are spending more on these services: their spend increased by 73% on average in the past five years, according to research of 72 UK universities by Times Radio and The Sunday Times released in January. This is despite almost half of universities expecting to be in financial deficit this summer, according to the Office for Students. \"Student services can do a lot, but it needs to be properly resourced, and there is increasing demand,\" says Dr Sweeney. \"We could be part of the whole drive to streamline… but you have to resource those services properly for them to be effective.\" Some academics argue it is not a university's job to look after students like a school teacher would. Another lecturer at Manchester, who prefers not to be named, argues that: \"Students are adults, they are over 18 when they are coming to university\". However, they concede that it is \"very hard on a human level\" to just turn students away. Dr Sweeney similarly emphasises that universities are not mental illness treatment centres. (Indeed, student services will always tell a student in serious crisis or immediate stress to seek help from their GP or NHS services.) But some students are put off by long NHS waiting times, including for mental health services. One argument is that universities need closer collaboration with NHS authorities to improve mental health care. In Manchester, local authorities have created a scheme called the Greater Manchester Universities Mental Health Service, under which local universities, including the University of Manchester, can escalate a case meaning authorities respond faster. Dr Sweeney says the scheme is currently working well. But she acknowledges that it is new, and relies on local NHS services having the capacity. However, others believe universities need to take on more responsibility. Natasha Abrahart's father Bob is one of them. \"If universities can't provide a safe and supportive environment then they are not fit for purpose,\" he argues. Natasha was just 20 when she took her own life on the day of an assessed presentation. Natasha - who had depression and anxiety - became distressed at the prospect of having to deliver the oral assessment to a full lecture theatre. In May 2022, Bob, together with Natasha's mother Maggie, sued the university. Bristol County Court found it had breached its obligations under the Equality Act to make \"reasonable adjustments\" to the way Natasha was assessed, and ordered the university to pay more than £50,000 in damages. The University of Bristol has not responded to a request for a comment. Student suicide rates are believed to be lower than the general population. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that 319 students died by suicide between the 2016-17 and 2019-20 academic years. However it stresses that there is no central database recording student suicides - instead, they cross-referenced death certificates with student records to identify potential cases of student suicides. In May, a report by the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Safety in Mental Health (NCISH) at the University of Manchester concluded universities needed to do more to prevent student suicides, including mandatory mental health awareness and suicide prevention training for staff. Bob and Maggie are calling on the government to introduce a statutory duty of care in higher education, or a legal obligation to protect students from harm. The court in Bristol found there was no \"statute or precedent\" establishing this duty of care. The Department for Education says it has no plans to introduce this because higher education providers already owe \"a duty of care to not cause harm to their students through the university's own actions\". Both Amosshe and Universities UK, which represents university vice-chancellors, oppose the change too. Amosshe says it would \"place unrealistic expectations over what higher education providers can control\". Yet most universities acknowledge something must change. Dr Sweeney says the sector could be doing more, as there is not a standardised student services model across higher education. But she also adds university is a \"more supportive environment than the workplace\". Meanwhile Dr Mann believes that it is about giving students the \"scaffolding\" to thrive. \"They're used to adults just stepping in and rescuing them. I think we need to teach them to rescue themselves.\" As for the students, many I spoke to say they still feel let down. \"I wish,\" says Imogen, \"I could say everything was great and I had a really supportive uni. But I can't.\" Support and information for anyone affected by the issues raised in this article can be found on the BBC Action Line website.

    "text": "Babies made using three people's DNA are born free of hereditary disease. Eight babies have been born in the UK using genetic material from three people to prevent devastating and often fatal conditions, doctors say. The method, pioneered by UK scientists, combines the egg and sperm from a mum and dad with a second egg from a donor woman. The technique has been legal here for a decade but we now have the first proof it is leading to children born free of incurable mitochondrial disease. These conditions are normally passed from mother to child, starving the body of energy. This can cause severe disability and some babies die within days of being born. Couples know they are at risk if previous children, family members or the mother has been affected. Children born through the three-person technique inherit most of their DNA, their genetic blueprint, from their parents, but also get a tiny amount, about 0.1%, from the second woman. This is a change that is passed down the generations. None of the families who have been through the process are speaking publicly to protect their privacy, but have issued anonymous statements through the Newcastle Fertility Centre where the procedures took place. \"After years of uncertainty this treatment gave us hope - and then it gave us our baby,\" said the mother of a baby girl. \"We look at them now, full of life and possibility, and we're overwhelmed with gratitude.\" The mother of a baby boy added: \"Thanks to this incredible advancement and the support we received, our little family is complete. \"The emotional burden of mitochondrial disease has been lifted, and in its place is hope, joy, and deep gratitude.\" Mitochondria are tiny structures inside nearly every one of our cells. They are the reason we breathe as they use oxygen to convert food into the form of energy our bodies use as fuel. Defective mitochondria can leave the body with insufficient energy to keep the heart beating as well as causing brain damage, seizures, blindness, muscle weakness and organ failure. About one in 5,000 babies are born with mitochondrial disease. The team in Newcastle anticipate there is demand for 20 to 30 babies born through the three-person method each year. Some parents have faced the agony of having multiple children die from these diseases. Mitochondria are passed down only from mother to child. So this pioneering fertility technique uses both parents and a woman who donates her healthy mitochondria. The science was developed more than a decade ago at Newcastle University and the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and a specialist service opened within the NHS in 2017. The eggs from both the mother and the donor are fertilised in the lab with the dad's sperm. The embryos develop until the DNA from the sperm and egg form a pair of structures called the pro-nuclei. These contain the blueprints for building the human body, such as hair colour and height. The pro-nuclei are removed from both embryos and the parents' DNA is put inside the embryo packed with healthy mitochondria. The resulting child is genetically related to their parents, but should be free from mitochondrial disease. A pair of reports, in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed 22 families have gone through the process at the Newcastle Fertility Centre. It led to four boys and four girls, including one pair of twins, and one ongoing pregnancy. \"To see the relief and joy in the faces of the parents of these babies after such a long wait and fear of consequences, it's brilliant to be able to see these babies alive, thriving and developing normally,\" Prof Bobby McFarland, the director of the NHS Highly Specialised Service for Rare Mitochondrial Disorders told the BBC. All of the babies were born free of mitochondrial disease and met their expected developmental milestones. There was a case of epilepsy, which cleared up by itself and one child has an abnormal heart rhythm which is being successfully treated. These are not thought to be connected to defective mitochondria. It is not known whether this is part of the known risks of IVF, something specific to the three-person method or something that has been detected only because the health of all babies born through this technique is monitored intensely. Another key question hanging over the approach has been whether defective mitochondria would be transferred into the healthy embryo and what the consequences could be. The results show that in five cases the diseased mitochondria were undetectable. In the other three, between 5% and 20% of mitochondria were defective in blood and urine samples. This is below the 80% level thought to cause disease. It will take further work to understand why this occurred and if it can be prevented. Prof Mary Herbert, from Newcastle University and Monash University, said: \"The findings give grounds for optimism. However, research to better understand the limitations of mitochondrial donation technologies, will be essential to further improve treatment outcomes.\" The breakthrough gives hope to the Kitto family. Kat's youngest daughter Poppy, 14, has the disease. Her eldest Lily, 16, may pass it onto her children. Poppy is in a wheelchair, is non-verbal and is fed through a tube. \"It's impacted a huge part of her life,\" says Kat, \"we have a lovely time as she is, but there are the moments where you realize how devastating mitochondrial disease is\". Despite decades of work there is still no cure for mitochondrial disease, but the chance to prevent it being passed on gives hope to Lily. \"It's the future generations like myself, or my children, or my cousins, who can have that outlook of a normal life,\" she says. The UK not only developed the science of three-person babies, but it also became the first country in the world to introduce laws to allow their creation after a vote in Parliament in 2015. There was controversy as mitochondria have DNA of their own, which controls how they function. It means the children have inherited DNA from their parents and around 0.1% from the donor woman. Any girls born through this technique would pass this onto their own children, so it is a permanent alteration of human genetic inheritance. This was a step too far for some when the technology was debated, raising fears it would open the doors to genetically-modified \"designer\" babies. Prof Sir Doug Turnbull, from Newcastle University, told me: \"I think this is the only place in the world this could have happened, there's been first class science to get us to where we are, there been legislation to allow it to move into clinical treatment, the NHS to help support it and now we've got eight children that seem to free of mitochondrial disease, what a wonderful result.\" Liz Curtis, the founder of the Lily Foundation charity said: \"After years of waiting, we now know that eight babies have been born using this technique, all showing no signs of mito. \"For many affected families, it's the first real hope of breaking the cycle of this inherited condition.\" Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "text": "NHS tracker - are hospital waiting times improving near you?. Every NHS hospital in England has been told to improve patient waiting times for planned treatment as the government has made hitting the 18-week target one of its key priorities for this parliament. By March 2026, the government wants to see at least 65% of patients waiting no longer than 18 weeks. To get there, every NHS trust has to either get to 60% or improve on its November 2024 figures by five percentage points - whichever is greater. That is just a stepping stone towards the ultimate goal of achieving 92% by July 2029. Use your postcode to find out whether waiting lists are getting better near you. BBC Verify's analysis included NHS trusts in England that had at least 5,000 people waiting for elective treatment in November 2024. Targets in other nations are different and the interim targets for next March set by the UK government do not apply. While Scotland aims for 90% of patients to be treated within 18 weeks of referral, in Wales the target is for 95% of patients to wait less than 26 weeks. In Northern Ireland, 55% of patients should wait no longer than 13 weeks for day case or inpatient treatment.

    "text": "Why are measles cases rising in the UK?. A young child has died at Liverpool's Alder Hey Hospital after contracting measles, raising concerns about the spread of the disease. Cases have been rising in the UK and around the world, with more than 500 reported since January in England alone. The increase is being blamed on the poor uptake of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. Measles is a highly contagious disease which is spread by coughs and sneezes. Common symptoms include: Small white spots may appear inside the mouth. A blotchy red or brown rash usually appears after a few days, typically on the face and behind the ears, before spreading. The rash can be harder to see on brown and black skin. Measles normally clears up within seven to 10 days. However, it can lead to pneumonia, meningitis, blindness and seizures. Babies and young children, pregnant women and those with a weakened immune system are at increased risk. Measles can be fatal, but this is rare. Between 2000-2023, 26 children and adults died in England and Wales from measles or related infections. Before the latest case in Liverpool, the last child to die as a result of measles complications was 10-year-old Renae Archer, in 2023. You can catch measles at any age. It is possible - but highly unlikely - to catch it twice as the body builds up immunity to the disease after being infected. Getting it while pregnant can lead to stillbirth, miscarriage or babies being born small. The NHS advises adults to ensure they have had both doses of the MMR vaccine before starting a family. There were 2,911 confirmed cases of measles in England in 2024, which is the highest annual total since 2012. According to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), this started with an outbreak in Birmingham, which was then overtaken by a surge of cases in London. More than 60% of the 2024 cases were in children aged 10 and under. As at 3 July, there had been 529 reported cases in England in 2025, with 68% occurring in children under 10: Alder Hey Hospital has treated 17 children for measles since June. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Unicef have warned that the number of measles cases in the European region doubled to 127,350 in 2024 - the highest level in 25 years. A report from the two organisations said children under the age of five accounted for more than 40% of the cases reported in Europe and central Asia. As at 4 July, there were nearly 1,300 confirmed measles cases in the US - a 33-year high. More than nine in 10 of those affected (92%) were either unvaccinated or did not know their vaccination status. Texas is the the worst-hit state with more than 700 cases. Kansas and New Mexico have also had outbreaks. At least three people have died and 155 others have been hospitalised. The number of young primary school children in the UK who have had both recommended doses of the MMR vaccine is below WHO targets. NHS figures for 2023-2024 show that 84.5% of children across the UK had received two MMR doses by their fifth birthday. The recommended figure is 95%. Across England, London had the lowest take-up at 73.3%, followed by the West Midlands at 83.1% and the North West at 84.5%. The WHO said vaccination rates have also fallen across Europe, leaving millions of children at risk. Child health experts say some parents underestimate the seriousness of measles because the success of the vaccine programme meant it had largely been eradicated. In addition, many routine health appointments were missed during the Covid pandemic. There are also still people who wrongly believe the MMR jab is linked to autism. Researcher Andrew Wakefield falsely claimed the two were connected in 1998. His work was later dismissed, and Wakefield was struck off by the General Medical Council in 2010, but fears about the jab persisted despite being disproven. The outbreak in the US follows a sharp rise in anti-vaccine sentiment. The current Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr previously spread misinformation about childhood vaccinations and had minimised the danger of measles. He also promoted unproven treatments like cod liver oil. As cases have grown, he has backtracked on the MMR vaccine, writing in a post on X that it was \"the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles\". Public health experts have warned that the US will lose measles elimination status if the disease continues to spread at the current rate for more than 12 months. The first measles vaccinations were introduced in the UK in 1968. The current two-dose MMR vaccine started in 1996 and is very effective. After both MMR doses, 99% of people are protected against measles and rubella and 88% are protected against mumps. The first MMR dose is usually given at 12 months old, while the second jab is administered at about three years and four months, before children start primary school. However, adults and children can have the MMR jab at any point via their GP. People who do not eat pork products can request an alternative jab called Priorix. If the MMR is not suitable, someone at immediate risk of catching measles can have a treatment called human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG). Most MMR side effects are mild but the injection site can be red, sore and swollen for a few days. Babies and young children may develop a high temperature for up to 72 hours. There is no evidence linking the MMR vaccine with autism. Morgan Betchley was \"brutalised\" by Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, her mother-in-law says. The Federal Trade Commission is inquiring into seven tech companies including Snap, Meta, OpenAI and XAI.

    "text": "Alzheimer's has isolated us, says Fiona Phillips' husband. The husband of TV presenter Fiona Phillips says they have become socially isolated since her Alzheimer's diagnosis. Phillips, who hosted ITV's GMTV breakfast programme, announced in 2023 that she had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's the previous year, at the age of 61. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Martin Frizell, a former editor of ITV's This Morning show, said: \"You become almost invisible.\" He added: \"We still have some close friends. But I think people think, oh gosh, Fiona, maybe she doesn't look the same, or they don't know what to say, or it brings into sharp focus their own mortality.\" At the time of her diagnosis, Phillips said she had suffered months of brain fog and anxiety - and initially had attributed the symptoms to the menopause. \"It's something I might have thought I'd get at 80,\" Phillips explained. \"But I was still only 61 years old.\" Mr Frizell said he now does not know what to do either with her cookery books or designer clothes - both things she no longer uses. \"Fiona hasn't cooked in two years,\" he said. \"Part of the heartache now is she's got this dressing room full of the most amazing clothes but this horrible disease means she's more than happy just wearing the same T-shirt, the same trousers, the same thing - day in, day out.\" Mother-of-two Phillips has written a memoir since her diagnosis, which is due to be released on Thursday. Mr Frizell contributed to the book, saying he had intended to write \"a few paragraphs\" but ended up writing \"24,000 words\". \"I started off writing about what a great woman she is and just how horrible it is and dreadfully unlucky that she is the latest in the long line of her family to get it,\" he told the Telegraph. \"Then I just got very angry as to what little support there is. As a family, we just kind of get through it and at some point we will need more support, but there's just nothing really.\" In 2023, Phillips said the disease had \"decimated\" her family - with her mother, father and uncle all receiving a diagnosis. She had cared for her parents and made two documentaries about the disease - one in 2009 called Mum, Dad, Alzheimer's and Me, about her family's history of dementia, and My Family and Alzheimer's in 2010. The NHS says the term dementia encompasses \"a group of symptoms associated with an ongoing decline of brain functioning\". Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the UK - but its exact cause is not yet fully understood. There is currently no cure for the disease, though some treatments can temporarily improve symptoms. One in three people born in the UK will be diagnosed with dementia, according to the Alzheimer's Society charity. Speaking to ITV's This Morning on Friday, Mr Frizell said: \"Society has decided we're not going to take it as seriously as we should. \"The money that's there for Alzheimer's research, it's like buying a Starbucks cup of coffee, basically trying to fight a disease. It's impossible.\" Phillips presented GMTV between 1993 and 2008. She has since led a number of documentaries and episodes of Panorama, and was a columnist for the Mirror. The simulation suits are helping health staff understand the frustration patients face every day. The actor, well known for his roles in the Die Hard franchise, was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, a condition his family publicly disclosed in 2023. The Manchester Camerata is also expanding its free music therapy programme for people with dementia. Scientists leading the trial at University College London believe the blood test could improve the accuracy of diagnosis of the disease to more than 90%.

    "text": "Vaccine roll-outs cut deaths by 60% - study. Emergency vaccination programmes – rolled out in response to outbreaks of five major diseases – are believed to have reduced deaths by around 60% over a period of 23 years, according to a new study. A similar number of infections are also thought to have been prevented. Researchers believe that vaccinations stopped much bigger outbreaks of illnesses like Ebola, cholera and yellow fever. The study also points to the significant economic benefits of vaccination programmes, which run into billions of dollars. Researchers say this is the first comprehensive study to assess the impact of emergency vaccination programmes in response to the outbreak of five infectious diseases – Ebola, measles, cholera, yellow fever and meningitis. They studied 210 different incidents from 2000 to 2023, covering 49 different countries. The vaccine roll-outs seem to have had an impressive impact, reducing deaths by nearly 60%. The number of overall cases of these infections were also reduced by nearly 60%. The swift deployment of vaccines also appears to have halted wider outbreaks. There were economic benefits too – worth an estimated $32 billion. These benefits come mainly from averting deaths and years of life lost to disability. But researchers believe this could be a significant underestimate of overall savings, as it doesn't take into account the costs of dealing with a wider outbreak, or the economic disruption caused by a more serious health emergency. It's believed the 2014 Ebola outbreak, which occurred before the existence of an approved vaccine, is estimated to have cost West African countries alone more than $53 billion. The study was backed by Gavi, the vaccine alliance, which was responsible for many of the programmes. Dr Sania Nishtar, the organisation's CEO, says the study shows just how important quick and effective vaccine roll-outs can be. \"For the first time, we are able to comprehensively quantify the benefit, in human and economic terms, of deploying vaccines against outbreaks of some of the deadliest infectious diseases. \"This study demonstrates clearly the power of vaccines as a cost-effective counter-measure to the increasing risk the world faces from outbreaks. \"It also underscores the importance of fully funding Gavi, so it can continue to protect communities in the next five years to come.\" Gavi is currently trying to secure a fresh round of funding in the face of global cuts to foreign aid.  Seen as a martyr in the struggle against white-minority rule, Steve Biko died in police custody in 1977. The 64-year-old has been sacked, although all the passengers were unharmed.

    "text": "South Africans fear spike in HIV infections as US aid cuts bite. Gugu used to collect her antiretrovirals from a USAID-funded clinic in central Johannesburg. But when President Trump's cuts to aid funding were announced earlier this year, she and thousands of other HIV-positive patients across South Africa suddenly faced an uncertain future. Gugu was lucky, the clinic where she got the medication that helps suppress her symptoms contacted her before it closed down. \"I was one of the people who was able to get their medication in bulk. I usually collect a three-month prescription. But before my clinic closed, they gave me nine months' worth of medication.\" She will run out of antiretrovirals (ARVs) in September, and then plans on going to her local public hospital for more. A former sex worker, the 54-year-old found out she was HIV-positive after she'd quit the industry. Ten years ago she got a chesty cough, and initially thought it was tuberculosis. She went to a doctor who told her she had a chest infection and treated her for it. But when the treatment failed, she went to a clinic to get an HIV test. \"By then I already assumed that I was HIV-positive, and I told the nurse this.\" She was right, and she has been on ARVs ever since. We're not using her real name at her request. She currently works as a project coordinator for an NGO. \"We help pregnant sex workers get their ARVs, to ensure their children are born HIV-negative. We also do home visits to make sure that the mothers take their medication on time, and to look after their babies when they go for their monthly check-ups.\" Many HIV-positive sex workers in South Africa relied on private clinics funded by the US government's now-defunct aid agency, USAID, to get their prescriptions and treatments. But most of the facilities closed after US President Donald Trump cut most foreign aid earlier this year. Gugu believes that many sex workers could be discouraged from going to public hospitals for their ARVs if they can no longer get them from clinics. \"The problem with going to public hospitals is the time factor. In order to get serviced at these facilities, you have to arrive at 4 or 5am, and they may spend the whole day waiting for their medication. For sex workers, time is money,\" Gugu says. She adds that she recently went to her local hospital with some friends to register her details and build a relationship with staff. \"The nurse who attended to us was very rude. She told us there was nothing special about sex workers.\" She thinks this could lead to many sex workers defaulting on their medication, \"especially because their hospital files contain a lot of personal information, and the concern is that sometimes the nurses at these local clinics aren't always the most sensitive in dealing with this kind of information\". In a  report released on Thursday, the UN body in charge of fighting HIV/Aids does not single out the US, but says that drastic cuts from a number of donors have sent shockwaves around the world, that the \"phenomenal progress\" in tackling the illness risks being reversed. \"New HIV infections have been reduced by 40% since 2010, and 4.4 million children have been protected from acquiring HIV since 2000. More than 26 million lives have been saved,\" UNAids says, warning that if the world does not act, there could be an extra six million new HIV infections and four million Aids-related deaths by 2029. UNAids said that, before the funding cuts, the annual numbers of new HIV infections and Aids-related deaths had sunk to their lowest levels in more than 30 years. All of the data published in the report is from before the US and other donors slashed funding earlier this year. But it does highlight how much progress could be lost as a result of these cuts. Sub-Saharan Africa has seen a 56% decline in the number of new infections. The region is still the epicentre of the epidemic - half of all new infections last year were from the continent. But four African countries - Lesotho, Malawi, Rwanda and Zimbabwe - were on track to achieve a 90% decline in new infections by 2030 compared with 2010. Another success story for Africa has been the performance of antiretrovirals, which help suppress HIV symptoms. Along with other medical advances in the field, they helped increase life in sub-Saharan Africa from 56 years in 2010 to 62 years in 2024. The turnaround began when then-US President George W Bush launched an ambitious programme to combat HIV/Aids in 2003, saying it would serve the \"strategic and moral interests\" of the US. Known as the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), it led to the investment of more than $100bn (£74bn) in the global HIV/Aids response - the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in the world. South Africa has about 7.7 million people living with HIV, the highest number in the world, according to UNAids. About 5.9 million of them receive antiretroviral treatment, resulting in a 66% decrease in Aids-related deaths since 2010, the UN agency adds. South Africa's government says Pepfar funding contributed about 17% to its HIV/Aids programme. The money was used for various projects, including running mobile clinics to make it easier for patients to get treatment. The Trump administration's cuts have raised concern that infection rates could spike again. \"I think we're going to start seeing an increase in the number of HIV infections, the number of TB cases, the number of other infectious diseases,\" Prof Lynn Morris, Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Johannesburg's Wits University, tells the BBC. \"And we're going to start seeing a reversal of what was essentially a real success story. We were getting on top of some of these things.\" Gugu points out that treatment is a matter of life and death, especially for vulnerable populations like sex workers. \"People don't want to default on their ARVs. They're scared that they're going to die if they don't get access to them. The cuts have also affected research aimed at finding an HIV vaccine and a cure for Aids. \"There's the long-term impact, which is that we're not going to be getting new vaccines for HIV,\" Prof Morris adds. \"We're not going to be keeping on top of viruses that are circulating. Even with new viruses that might appear, we're not going to have the surveillance infrastructure that we once had.\" South Africa has been one of the global leaders in HIV research. Many of the medications that help prevent the virus, and which have benefitted people around the world, were trialled in South Africa. This includes Prep (pre-exposure prophylaxis), a medication which stops HIV-negative people from catching the virus. Another breakthrough preventive drug released this year, Lenacapavir, an injection taken twice a year and that offers total protection from HIV, was also tried in South Africa. In a lab at Wits University's Health Sciences campus, a small group of scientists are still working on a vaccine for HIV. They are part of the Brilliant Consortium, a group of labs working across eight African countries to develop a vaccine for the virus. \"We were developing a vaccine test to see how well that works, and then we would trial it on humans,\" Abdullah Ely, an Associate Professor at Wits University, tells the BBC in his lab. \"The plan was to run the trials in Africa based on research carried out by Africans because we want that research to actually benefit our community as well as all mankind.\" But the US funding cuts threw their work into doubt. \"When the stop order came, it meant we had to stop everything. Only some of us have been able to get additional funding so we could continue our work. It's set us back months, probably could even be a year,\" Prof Ely says. The lab lacks funding to carry out clinical trials scheduled for later this year. \"That is a very big loss to South Africa and the continent. It means that any potential research that comes out of Africa will have to be tested in Europe, or the US,\" Prof Ely says. In June, universities asked the government for a bailout of 4.6bn South African rand ($260m; £190m) over the next three years to cover some of the funding lost from the US. \"We are pleading for support because South Africa is leading in HIV research, but it's not leading for itself. This has ramifications on the practice and policies of the entire globe,\" says Dr Phethiwe Matutu, head of Universities South Africa. South Africa's Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi announced on Wednesday that some alternative funding for research had been secured. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust have agreed to donate 100m rand each with immediate effect, while the government would make available 400m rand over the next three years, he said. This would bring the total to 600m rand, way below the 4.6bn rand requested by researchers. As for Gugu, she had hoped that by the time she was elderly, a cure for HIV/Aids would have been found, but she is less optimistic now. \"I look after a nine-year-old. I want to live as long as I can to keep taking care of him,\" she tells the BBC. \"This isn't just a problem for right now, we have to think about how it's going to affect the next generation of women and young people.\" Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

    "text": "Is RFK Jr's divisive plan to Make America Healthy Again fearmongering - or revolutionary?. Listen to Jim read this article There's a saying that Robert F Kennedy Jr is very fond of. He used it on the day he was confirmed as US health secretary. \"A healthy person has a thousand dreams, a sick person only has one,\" he said as he stood in the Oval Office. \"60% of our population has only one dream – that they get better.\" The most powerful public health official in the US has made it his mission to tackle what he describes as an epidemic of chronic illness in America, a catch-all term that covers everything from obesity and diabetes to heart disease. His diagnosis that the US is experiencing an epidemic of ill health is a view shared by many healthcare experts in the country. But Kennedy also has a history of promoting unfounded health conspiracies, from the suggestion that Covid-19 targeted and spared certain ethnic groups to the idea that chemicals in tap water could be making children transgender. And after taking office, he slashed thousands of jobs at the Department of Health and Human Services and eliminated whole programmes at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). \"On the one hand, it's extraordinarily exciting to have a federal official take on chronic disease,\" says Marion Nestle, a retired professor of public health at New York University. \"On the other, the dismantling of the federal public health apparatus cannot possibly help with the agenda.\" Kennedy is reviled by parts of the medical and scientific communities. He was described to me as an \"evil nihilist\" by Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease doctor and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University. But even some of Kennedy's critics accept that he is bringing drive and ambition to areas of healthcare that have been neglected. Is it possible that the man who attracts so much criticism - and in some quarters, hate - might actually start making America healthy again? There's one industry that Kennedy had set his sights on long before joining the Trump administration: multinational food companies have, he has said, poisoned American children with artificial additives already banned in other countries. \"We have a generation of kids who are swimming around in a toxic soup right now,\" he claimed on Fox News last year. His first target was food colourings, with a promise to phase out the use of petroleum-based dyes by the end of 2026. Chemicals, with names like 'Green No. 3' and 'Red No. 40', have been linked to hyperactivity and behavioural issues in children, and cancer in some animal studies. \"What's happening in this administration is really interesting,\" says Vani Hari, a food blogger and former Democrat who is now an influential voice in the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement. \"MAHA is all about how do we get people off processed food, and one way to do that is to regulate the chemicals companies use.\" There are some signs this pressure may be paying off. The food giant PepsiCo, for example, said in a recent trading update that Lays crisps and Tostitos snacks \"will be out of artificial colours by the end of this year\". Kennedy struck a voluntary agreement with the food industry but it only came after individual states from California to West Virginia had already started introducing their own laws. \"In the case of food dyes, companies will have to act because states are banning them [anyway] and they won't want to have to formulate separate products for separate states,\" says Prof Nestle, an author and longtime critic of the industry. More recently Kennedy has signalled he backs a radical food bill in Texas that could target additives in some products  ranging from sweets, to cereals and fizzy drinks. Packets may soon have to carry a high-contrast label stating, \"WARNING: This product contains an ingredient that is not recommended for human consumption by the appropriate authority in Australia, Canada, the European Union, or the United Kingdom.\" The Consumer Brands Association, which represents some of the largest food manufacturers, opposes this, saying the ingredients used in the US food supply are safe and have been rigorously studied. It's difficult to imagine that kind of regulation could ever be signed off in a state like Texas without the political backing of Kennedy and President Trump. \"He can't change everything in a short amount of time, but I think the issue of food dyes will soon be history,\" says Ms Hari, who testified before the Senate on this subject last year. But others worry that the flurry of announcements on additives is tinkering around the edges of what is a much wider problem. \"While some of these individual actions are important, they are a drop in the ocean in the larger context of chronic disease,\" argues Nicola Hawley, professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Public Health. \"There is a focus on personal choice and access to natural food, but that completely ignores the big, systematic and structural barriers [to healthy eating] like poverty and really aggressive marketing of junk food to children.\" The US government, for example, still heavily subsidises crops including corn and soya beans, key ingredients in processed foods. Kennedy is now updating the US national dietary guidelines, an important document used to shape everything from school meals to assistance programmes for the elderly. A reduction in added sugars and a switch to more locally sourced whole foods is expected. Plus he has called on states to ban millions of Americans from using food stamps, a welfare benefit, to buy junk food or sugar-sweetened drinks. He has also backed local officials who want to stop adding fluoride to drinking water, describing it as a \"dangerous neurotoxin\". It is used in some countries, including in parts of the US, to prevent tooth decay, and whilst there is still debate about the possible health effects, the NHS says a review of the risks has found \"no convincing evidence\" to support any concerns. Other fluoride research has found the mineral only has detrimental health effects at extremely high levels. Prof Hawley also argues there is a tension between Kennedy's \"important message\" on food and chronic disease, and what she feels is a lack of policies backed by solid scientific evidence. \"You've got this challenge of him drifting into misinformation about the links between additives and chronic disease, or environmental risk factors,\" she argues. \"And that really just undermines the science.\" That tension is even clearer when it comes to another of Kennedy's big concerns. Vaccines are still listed on the CDC website as one of the great public health achievements of the last century, alongside family planning and tobacco control. They prevent countless cases of disease and disability each year, and save millions of lives, according to the American Medical Association. Kennedy, though, is the best-known vaccine sceptic in the country. The activist group he ran for eight years, Children's Health Defense, repeatedly questioned the safety and efficacy of vaccination. In 2019 he described the disgraced British doctor Andrew Wakefield as the \"most unfairly maligned person in modern history\" and told a crowd in Washington that \"any just society\" would be building statues of him. Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register in 2010 after his research falsely linked the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine to autism, leading to a spike in measles cases in England and some other countries. Over the last year, Kennedy has repeatedly insisted he is not \"anti-vax\" and will not be \"taking away anybody's vaccines\". Faced with a deadly measles outbreak in unvaccinated children in west Texas, he posted that the MMR was \"the most effective way to prevent the spread of the disease\". In other comments though, he described vaccination as a \"personal choice\" and emphasised alternative treatments such as vitamin A supplements. A huge deal with the drugmaker Moderna to develop a vaccine to combat bird flu in humans was scrapped, and new rules were brought in which could mean some vaccines need extra testing before they can be updated each winter. In May, Kennedy posted a video on social media saying the government would no longer endorse Covid vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. However, some doctors point out that reducing eligibility would simply bring the US into line with other countries, including the UK, where free Covid boosters are restricted to those over 75 or with weakened immune systems. \"They are really just aligning themselves with everyone else, which is not in any way outrageous,\" says Prof Adam Finn, a paediatric doctor and one of the UK's leading experts on vaccines. Then in June, Kennedy suddenly sacked all 17 members of the influential expert committee, which advises the CDC on vaccine eligibility. He accused the panel of being \"plagued with persistent conflicts of interest\" and rubber-stamping new vaccines without proper scrutiny. A new, much smaller, committee handpicked by the administration now has the power to change, or even drop, critical recommendations to immunise Americans for certain diseases, as well as shape the childhood vaccination programme. \"It underscores just how much we are backsliding now,\" says Dr Amesh Adalja, the infectious disease doctor and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University. \"I think increasingly the panel will become irrelevant if RFK Jr is able to shape it the way he wants to.\" The new panel made its first decision last week, voting to stop recommending a small number of flu vaccines that still contain the preservative thimerosal, something Kennedy wrote a book about in 2015. His critics say that a new era of vaccine policy has arrived in the US. Whilst his supporters say no subject, including vaccine safety, should be considered off-limits. \"Everything has to be open to discussion and Bobby Kennedy is not anti-vaccine, he's anti-corruption,\" argues Tony Lyons, who co-founded the political action committee that supported his independent presidential campaign. \"It's about being pro-science, pro-capitalism, and believing you have an obligation to the public to do a thorough job of researching any product that is put in the arms of 40 million children.\" Weeks after Kennedy took office news emerged that the CDC would open a research project into the link between vaccines and autism. Since Wakefield's now-discredited Lancet paper in 1998, which linked autism to the MMR vaccine given to children, there have been numerous international studies that have looked at this in detail and found no reputable link. \"There is nothing to debate any more, it has been settled by science,\" says Eric Fombonne, an autism researcher and professor emeritus at Oregon Health & Science University. Kennedy, though, has hired David Geier, a noted vaccine sceptic, to look again at the data. Today autism is widely understood to be a lifelong spectrum condition. It can include those with high support needs who are non-speaking, and those with above-average intelligence who might struggle with social interaction or communication. Most researchers believe a rise in cases over decades is down to a broadening in the way children with autism are defined, as well as improved awareness, understanding and screening. But in April, Kennedy dismissed that idea, describing autism as \"preventable\". He blamed a mysterious environmental trigger for the increase in eight-year-olds being diagnosed. \"This is coming from an environmental toxin… [in] our air, our water, our medicines, our food,\" he said. He pledged a massive research effort to find that cause by September and \"eliminate those exposures\". Dr Fombonne strongly disputes this. \"It is nonsensical and shows a complete absence of understanding,\" he says. \"We have known for many years that autism has a strong genetic component.\" In the same speech, Kennedy said that many autistic children will never \"pay taxes, never hold a job. They'll never play baseball. They'll never write a poem. They'll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\" Many in the autism community are angry. \"What we're seeing here is a fear-based rhetoric and [a] misleading narrative that is causing harm and perpetuating stigma,\" says Kristyn Roth from the Autism Society of America. But some parents of autistic children are more supportive. Emily May, a writer who is the mother of a child with autism, wrote in The New York Times that she found herself \"nodding along as Mr Kennedy spoke about the grim realities of profound autism\". \"His remarks echo the reality and pain of a subset of parents of children with autism who feel left out of much of the conversation,\" she wrote. The administration has since watered down that promise to find the reasons for autism by September but it is still promising detailed findings of its research by March 2026. Ultimately, Robert Kennedy has only been in the job a matter of months. Already though he's asking some big questions – particularly about chronic disease – which have never been asked in the same way by a health secretary before. For the first time that issue has both political attention and bipartisan support in the US. He is clearly not afraid to take on what he perceives to be vested interests in the food and drug industries, and he is still firmly supported by President Trump. Tony Lyons, who has published books by Kennedy, calls him \"uniquely qualified\" for the most powerful job in US public health. \"He's a corruption fighter. He has seen what all these kinds of companies do, not just pharmaceutical companies but food companies, and he wants them to do a better job,\" he says. Robert Kennedy's background as an environmental lawyer taking on big business and the establishment has clearly shaped the views he holds today. But Jerold Mande, a former federal food policy advisor in three administrations, worries that Kennedy's own views and biases will mean some of the solutions he's reaching for are predetermined and unsupported by the evidence. Now a professor of nutrition at Harvard, Prof Mande describes Kennedy as an imperfect messenger and says he has \"great concerns\" about the administration's approach to aspects of public health, from tobacco control to vaccination, where there is \"no question that what he's doing is going to result in enormous harm.\" \"At a high level, I'm optimistic... but you still need to come up with the right answers, and those answers can only be found through science,\" says Prof Mande. \"We now have a shot and he's provided that by making it a priority. But it's how you use that shot that's going to determine whether it's a success or not. And that is where the jury is still out.\" Top image credits: Chip Somodevilla / Staff via Getty and Tom Williams via Getty BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "text": "How is your hospital doing as NHS battles to bring down waiting times?. Doctors and patient groups warn that the NHS in England is facing an uphill struggle on the government's number one NHS priority – improving hospital waiting times. They are concerned about the lack of progress towards hitting the 18-week waiting time target, one of Labour's key election pledges. It has not been met since 2015. Since the election, the proportion of patients waiting less than 18 weeks has improved, but by less than a percentage point. And an analysis of hospital trusts by BBC Verify found over a third are seeing a smaller share of patients within 18 weeks since the NHS improvement plan was announced in January. But the government said it was premature to suggest progress was too slow as the NHS had only started to push forward with the government's improvement plan in April. Before that, it had focussed on other priorities, including tackling the very longest waits. It said the fact waiting times had continued to improve even during winter - the first time this had happened for 10 years - was encouraging. And in an interview with the BBC, Health Secretary Wes Streeting said progress would go \"further and faster\" in the coming years, helped by the extra money being invested and the 10-year NHS plan, due to be published next week. He said lots had been achieved so far, including millions more appointments being carried out and the total number of patients on the waiting list dropping to below 7.4 million, its lowest level for two years. On the 18-week target, he acknowledged there was \"much more to do\", before adding: \"There's a big challenge here. Are we going to meet it? Absolutely. We are not going to let people down.\" The government has promised to hit the target by March 2029, which requires 92% of patients to be seen within 18 weeks. In January, every hospital trust was given their own individual performance targets to meet by March 2026 as the first step in achieving that pledge. BBC Verify is launching an interactive tool, which we will update when there is new data, so you can find out how well your local NHS services are doing. We have included NHS trusts in England that had at least 5,000 cases waiting in November. John Winnik does not know when he will get treatment for a problem with his back. The grandfather from West Yorkshire, who has arthritis, has been on an NHS waiting list for nine months so far - much longer than the 18 weeks the health service says should be the limit. The 73-year-old paid privately to go to Lithuania for a right hip replacement last year, having spent more than a year on the NHS waiting list. He's also having injections in his left hip, which will eventually need replacing. \"I'm living in constant pain,\" said Mr Winnik, a self-employed consultant in the glass lamination industry. \"I've forgotten what it is like to not be in pain, to be honest. I haven't played golf for two years and if I do five minutes of gardening, I'm shattered.\" Royal College of Surgeons of England president Tim Mitchell said: \"The NHS is changing course, but the sails still lack wind. \"Progress is being made in some parts of the country, but it's too slow to meet the government's ambition of hitting the 18-week target by the end of this parliament. \"Delayed operations mean patients left waiting in pain, with their condition potentially deteriorating.\" He said the extra money being put into the NHS in the coming years would help, but \"serious underinvestment\" in infrastructure like operating theatres over the years is hampering efforts. Deborah Alsina, chief executive of the patient group Versus Arthritis, also has doubts, saying there was scepticism about whether the rapid progress needed could be achieved. And she added: \"It is impossible to overstate the personal, physical and mental toll of being stuck on a waiting list in daily pain, sometimes for years. \"There's also a wider impact on society, with many people on waiting lists having to drop out of work, despite wanting to stay in employment, and becoming increasingly reliant on others.\" The interim targets for March 2026 mean trusts either have to be seeing 60% of patients within 18 weeks of referral or improve on their November 2024 position by five percentage points - whichever is the greater. The NHS overall in England is expected to ensure 65% of patients do not wait longer than 18 weeks - currently less than 60% are. The majority of trusts have already started making progress, however a BBC Verify analysis shows 50 - more than one third - are now further away from the target since November 2024. Once the trusts that have improved are taken into account the overall trend though is positive.  A handful of trusts have already got to where they need to be by next March - as long as they can keep their waiting lists down. Mersey and West Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust had more than 48,000 patients waiting less than 18 weeks so far for treatment, 64.2% of the total, in April. That is up from 58.7% in November. East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust also reached 60.1% in April, up from 54.9% in November. The biggest target for improvement was set for The Princess Alexandra Hospital Trust in Harlow, according to our analysis. In November, 41.8% of its patients were waiting less than 18 weeks. By April, that had risen to about 48.8% - one of the biggest improvements in England so far. But it needs to rise further by more than 11 percentage points by next March. PAHT chief executive Thom Lafferty said they were \"delighted\" with their progress. \"We recognise the impact for patients who are waiting for care and we are enhancing integration and collaboration with our partners to ensure that patients can access the right care, in the right place, at the right time.\" Some trusts have a higher mountain to climb because their figures have dipped since November. Mid and South Essex NHS Trust started out with 52.8% of patients waiting less than 18 weeks in November. But when the clock started in April, it had fallen to 47%. Two of its theatres at Basildon Hospital have been closed for work along with some of the trust's procedure rooms and it has had an increase in referrals. Chief executive Matthew Hopkins said it was putting on extra clinics and had a new orthopaedic procedure room opening soon, adding: \"We are confident we will improve our waiting times and improve patient experience.\" Others that have fallen despite requiring large improvements include the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital (RJAH) in Shropshire (down from 48.3% to 44.9%) and Countess of Chester, down from 49.6% to 47.1%. Cathy Chadwick, chief operating officer for Countess of Chester, said more clinics and investment in new technology would bring down waiting lists and the trust was confident of meeting the target by next March. A spokesman for RJAH said: \"We have a clear ambition to hit the target of 60% by March 2026, and are confident that the plans we have put in place will enable us to do so.\" Targets in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are different and the interim targets for next March set by the UK government do not apply. However, the NHS is not meeting the waiting time targets in any nation. While Scotland aims for 90% of patients to be treated within 18 weeks of referral, in Wales the target is for 95% of patients to wait less than 26 weeks. In Northern Ireland, 55% of patients should wait no longer than 13 weeks for day case or inpatient treatment.

    "text": "Emma is doing something she swore she never would - buying her kids vapes. Emma is doing something she swore she would never do. In an attempt to have some control over her children's vaping habits, she's resorted to buying them the vapes herself. She's not proud of it, but says it feels like the only way to keep her two teenagers safe and reduce the high levels of nicotine they were consuming. \"It went against every bone in my body to do that, but they're addicted,\" Emma says. \"It's not a simple case of telling them to stop – it is so much harder than that.\" Emma believes her son, who she has asked the BBC not to name, began vaping in primary school. He managed to keep it from her for a while, but by the time he got to high school, his protests of \"that vape's not mine\" had started to wear thin. By the time Emma's son was 15, he was becoming breathless, contracted tonsillitis, and, at one point, was in so much pain, Emma called an ambulance. \"The paramedics said the incessant vaping could be causing this,\" she says. \"They told him to try and stop, or at the very least cut down.\" It was then Emma decided something had to change – she was going to take control and buy the vapes - trying to reduce their nicotine intake from 20mg to 10mg. \"I warned them – if I see them with a device that has more nicotine in – then I'll stop buying them any, full stop.\" Emma says she felt she could then be confident the vapes would be from a reputable supplier, they wouldn't be illegal and contain other harmful products, and she could control the level of nicotine. Not only is it illegal to sell vapes to anyone under the age of 18, it is also illegal to buy them for anyone underage. Emma knows what she is doing isn't legal, but feels this was her only choice. She believes she has managed to reduce her son's nicotine intake, in part by buying the vapes, but also by having such an open conversation with him. But Emma says the disposable vape ban, which came into effect on 1 June, has had little impact on her children's nicotine consumption. It was introduced due to environmental concerns and to reduce the rising number of children and young people vaping. While vapes provide a far healthier alternative to cigarettes, there are concerns that vaping provides a gateway into nicotine addiction - with disposable vapes enticing children and young people with their fruity flavours and cheap prices. Health experts agree anyone who does not smoke should not start vaping, as it may cause long-term damage to the lungs, heart and brain. But weeks after the ban came into force, Kate Pike from the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, says she fears it won't make any difference - and she says some rechargeable vapes, which are still legal to buy, are being marketed directly at children. \"We are finding compliant products – vapes that are refillable and rechargeable – with packs of stickers in them,\" she says. \"What adult is going to want to decorate their vape with stickers?\" She also says it is very difficult to tell the difference between the now-illegal disposables and the legal refillable vapes. And due to some being fitted with pre-filled pods, they are still being used \"like disposable vapes and discarded.\"  At Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, home to the UK's first NHS vaping clinic for children, Professor Rachel Isba says parents should not be hard on themselves – they are fighting a battle against the might of a huge vaping industry. \"The important thing is not to judge your child; the world our young people live in is a difficult place to grow up in,\" she says. \"There are so many competing pressures.\" Her clinic supports 11-15-year-olds who have been referred by other NHS healthcare professionals. It has been open since January and already has a six-week waiting list. \"The children that come to see me have to want to see me and understand why they are here,\" Prof Isba says. \"It could be that they are noticing a change with their bodies – they struggle to play sport without being out of breath for instance, or they're coughing up blood, or they just know they're addicted and they want to stop or cut down.\" She says some young people are sleeping with vapes under their pillows so they can get a nicotine hit in the middle of the night, and their addiction can be so strong they experience \"micro withdrawals\" in school. \"They are consuming nicotine so frequently that they begin to feel anxious if they don't have it – even for the length of a double maths lesson, for example.\" They then think they need the vape to reduce the anxiety, she explains, but it is nicotine withdrawal that is causing those feelings in the first place. Prof Isba offers nicotine replacement therapy – such as gums and patches – and talks to them about how vaping affects their lives. \"We might discuss ways they might be able to cut down, what triggers them to vape and even how much money they might save simply by not vaping.\" She says the government's Tobacco and Vapes bill is a good step forward but would like to see more paediatric addiction services across the NHS. The problem is \"far greater\" than her clinic, she says, and she is concerned vaping could become a gateway drug into smoking and other dependences. Dan from Twickenham, a father of three boys, agrees. He says the conversation about youth vaping is redundant because, he says, that \"horse has bolted\". His 17-year-old got expelled from school in February because he was caught with cannabis in his vape, and his 14-year-old was close to losing his school place recently because of a similar issue. \"Vaping is a gateway drug,\" Dan says. \"They become addicted to nicotine and then harder stuff follows. \"They've definitely smoked [cigarettes] and now my eldest is addicted to nicotine pouches. It's never ending.\" A government spokesperson told the BBC it was taking \"tough action\" to tackle youth vaping - including giving Trading Standards the power to issue £200 on-the-spot fines to anyone found selling tobacco or vapes to people underage. They also added that single-use vapes were a \"blight on our streets\" and that the government had made it compulsory for all vape retailers to provide recycling bins. Morgan Betchley was \"brutalised\" by Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, her mother-in-law says. More than 2,000 NHS patients have been treated with UK-donated blood plasma since a ban was lifted. A coroner says confusion over whether a man needed to see a mental health team contributed to his death.

    "text": "I lost £15,000 after going to an IVF middleman. IVF patients are being warned over unregulated \"concierge clinics\" after a popular one went bust leaving scores of clients without treatment or refunds. As the number of privately funded IVF cycles has risen, online concierge companies have emerged, acting as \"middlemen\" between patients, donors and doctors. The fertility watchdog has said that as these clinics do not provide IVF treatment directly, it does not have powers to regulate them. It is calling for the law to be strengthened to protect patients. Syreeta Sandhu lost nearly £15,000 when her concierge clinic went bust. \"You're on your knees,\" she said. \"Upset has turned to frustration and anger.\" The 40-year-old mother-of-two contacted online firm Apricity Fertility after four failed rounds of IVF and five miscarriages, in the hope of having a third child. She paid Apricity, which matched her with an egg donor and contracted established clinic King's Fertility. She was due to start treatment in December last year when her appointments were cancelled without explanation. Syreeta found out via the company's app that it was ceasing operations on 1 January. When she contacted King's, the clinic said data protection rules meant it did not have access to her file or details of her egg donor. It had not been paid by Apricity so her treatment could not begin. \"When you're on this journey, every month counts. You'll do anything, and you do throw lots of money at it,\" she said. \"It takes a long time to meet [medical staff] you can trust,\" she said. \"I spent almost 12 months building that trust and it just dropped off.\" Concierge clinics offer services like matching patients with donors and doctors, booking appointments and posting medication. It is not clear how many there are operating in the UK but experts believe their number is growing. Satellite arrangements – where patients attend medical appointments with one doctor, usually their own GP, and then undergo the IVF process elsewhere – is an established set-up in fertility care. But concierge clinics don't have physical premises or store eggs, sperm or embryos themselves. The fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), is warning patients that these new services are not covered by its protections. Clare Ettinghausen, director of strategy and corporate affairs at the HFEA, said: \"The fallout from Apricity's closure and the effect it had on patients highlights how the current law does not reflect the range and type of fertility treatments being offered today.\" She said the watchdog was calling for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act to be revised to take account of the different ways fertility services are provided. Syreeta is one of 52 patients owed money by Apricity. The company owes a total of £119,000 to its patients, according to the liquidator appointed to manage its debts, Cork Gully. Beth Rodgers, 32, from Belfast has Turner syndrome, a rare genetic condition that means her ovaries do not produce eggs. Because Northern Ireland has a severe shortage of donor eggs, Beth had to secure a donor in England. She and her partner paid Apricity £4,600 and had been matched with an egg donor. \"Then I saw a comment on a Facebook group saying 'thinking of everyone affected by the Apricity news,'\" she said. \"There was no communication, no number to call.\" The couple were able to claim some of the money back on their insurance but it did not cover a £385 fee for a doctor's appointment and £985 for donor compensation. \"Time was probably the biggest thing I felt I lost. It was such a long process,\" said Beth. She has now restarted treatment with a regulated clinic. She has had appointments with a doctor in the Republic of Ireland and travelled to Manchester for the embryo transfer. That transfer was unsuccessful but she will be able to get another round of IVF on her insurance with a different egg donor. In recent years, more British couples have paid for private fertility treatment, in part because IVF on the NHS is a postcode lottery. Jonathan, not his real name, and his wife went through five failed rounds of IVF before they went to Apricity. They paid £10,000 for treatment with their savings and a loan. \"We've been told there's no realistic chance of getting our money back,\" he said. \"We haven't been able to resume treatment yet as we're still trying to raise finance.\" Cork Gully told Jonathan and other patients in a letter seen by the BBC: \"It is unlikely that there will be funds to pay to patients.\" It said any affected patients should get in touch. The BBC asked Mel Chacksfield, who was chief executive of Apricity when it ceased operations, why the business had gone under and if patients would be refunded but she did not respond to our request. However, Caroline Noublanche, one of the company's founders and the previous chief executive, told the BBC it had \"faced sudden and irreversible financial difficulties in December when planned investment from an investor was withdrawn\". Prof Emily Jackson is a researcher in medical law and ethics at the London School of Economics. She said: \"You need a licence to do things with embryos and sperm and eggs but you don't need any licence to offer to arrange things on the internet. \"For people thinking about their options, it is probably sensible to opt for treatment in an HFEA-licensed clinic, because they have responsibilities towards patients in the event of closure.\" Those responsibilities mean that if an HFEA-licensed clinic closes, it has to give patients information and ensure they are supported. The clinic must also ensure all eggs, sperm and embryos that are in storage are kept safe. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care told BBC News: \"While digital or 'virtual' clinics do not currently fall within the remit of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, ministers have met with its chair to discuss the emerging regulatory challenges. \"The government is currently considering the HFEA's recommendations on modernising fertility law. We would advise all those looking at using digital clinics to carry out thorough research before making any decisions.\" King's Fertility, which was providing Syreeta's treatment, was a contractor of Apricity's and is now a creditor of the company. Its director, Dr Ippokratis Sarris, a consultant in reproductive medicine, said it was likely more concierge clinics would emerge in the future as patients look for convenience and flexibility. \"The shift toward more remote and digital models of care is an inevitable progression in today's world. This is increasingly what patients want, and often prefer, so it's important that we don't deny them that choice.\" But he advised patients to do careful research before choosing a provider, and to be cautious about paying upfront for multi-cycle packages. \"It's wise to look into how long a clinic has been established, who owns it (NHS, private individual, or private equity), and make an informed choice,\" he added. \"We shouldn't resist change, but we do need to be proactive in shaping it responsibly.\" Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

    "text": "What is chickenpox and how can I get my child vaccinated?. Young children in the UK will soon be offered a free chickenpox vaccine on the NHS. It will be added to the list of standard childhood vaccinations from January 2026, and there will be a catch-up programme for older children.  Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV). The virus is transmitted through direct contact between people, or through airborne droplets in coughs and sneezes. It is very easy to catch, especially if you've never had it before. While it mostly affects children - around half have had it by their fourth birthday - people of any age can get it. The first symptoms include a fever, muscle aches and pains and generally feeling unwell. A couple of days later, an itchy, spotty rash appears. These red or pink dots can appear anywhere on the body, including inside the mouth. Some children might have only a few spots, but others can be covered from head to toe. The spots fill up with fluid and become blisters before crusting over to form scabs, which eventually drop off and clear up. You are contagious and can spread chickenpox to other people from two days before the first spots develop until they have all formed scabs, which is usually five days after they first appear. Most cases in children are mild, although they will feel unwell and will need to miss school or nursery for several days. Some children will go on to develop complications. In rare cases chicken pox can cause a swelling of the brain, called encephalitis; an inflammation of the lungs, called pneumonitis; and stroke, which can result in hospitalisation and - very rarely - death. Chickenpox is often more serious in very young infants and adults. It can be dangerous in pregnancy, causing complications in both the mother and the baby. It's possible to get chickenpox more than once, but that is very unusual. Some people who have had chickenpox develop a related condition called shingles later in life. You can already get the chickenpox vaccine privately in the UK, at a cost of up to £200. But experts say adding the varicella vaccine to the official NHS childhood immunisation programme will dramatically reduce the number of people who catch chickenpox, leading to far fewer serious cases. The vaccine doesn't guarantee lifetime immunity, but it does greatly reduce the risk of someone developing chickenpox or having a bad case. Serious side effects, such as a severe allergic reaction, are very rare. From January 2026, children will be automatically offered two doses at 12 and 18 months of age. They will get the combined MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella and varicella. It is a live vaccine which means it contains a weakened version of the chickenpox virus. As such, it is not recommended for those with a compromised immune system because of an illness like HIV or as a result of treatment such as chemotherapy. The move will bring the UK into line with other countries which already offer routine varicella vaccination, including Germany, Canada, Australia and the US. It had previously been thought that vaccinating children against chickenpox would cause a problematic rise in shingles, but a recent long-term study from the US disproved that theory. The committee which advises the government on vaccinations - the JCVI - recommended that all children be given the MMRV in November 2023. It also suggested that there should be a temporary catch-up programme for slightly older children who will just miss out. Details of this are expected in due course. The decision to vaccinate against chickenpox was announced as new data revealed none of the main childhood vaccines in England reached the 95% uptake target in 2024/25. Some 91.9% of five-year-olds had received one dose of the MMR vaccine, unchanged from 2023/24 and the lowest level since 2010/11, according to the UK Health Security Agency. You cannot catch shingles. It is an extremely painful condition that can develop years after a chickenpox infection. That is because when people get chickenpox, the virus stays in the body and can be reactivated later, which causes shingles. This might happen, for example, if your immune system is weakened because of stress, certain conditions, or treatments like chemotherapy. For many, it's a painful skin rash - usually on the chest or abdomen - on one side of the body. Medicine (antiviral tablets) can help to speed up recovery and avoid longer-lasting problems. A shingles vaccine is available on the NHS for: You can get shingles more than once, so it's important to get vaccinated even if you've had shingles before. If you get shingles after being vaccinated, the symptoms can be much milder. Angie Bunce-Mason, whose daughter died aged three, says the announcement is welcome news. All young children in England and Wales will be offered a free chickenpox vaccine by the NHS from January 2026. A Hampshire man who caught West Nile virus in India is raising awareness of the disease. More than 70 cases of the chikungunya virus were reported in the UK in the first six months of this year. It's hoped phages could give us new ways of treating infections which are immune to antibiotics. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

    "text": "Caffeine pouch craze: A teenage trend troubling some experts. A growing number of US teenagers are using caffeine pouches to get an energy rush, say experts who worry the trend could soon take off in the UK. The small teabag-like pouches, placed between the lip and gum, deliver a quick caffeine hit, straight to the bloodstream. Some social media influencers are pushing products, recommending them to gym-goers for performance or to students who want to be alert for exams. TikTok Shop sells lots of brands and flavours that could appeal to young people, says Dr Rob van Dam from George Washington University. But with a single pouch containing as much caffeine as two cups of regular coffee, it could be easy to take too much and get bad side effects, he says. There is already growing concern in the UK about young people using nicotine pouches or snus. Caffeine pouches are also discreet - you may not be able to tell if someone has one in their mouth - making it easy to hide from parents and teachers. Some fans of the product boast online about \"buzzing\" from using two pouches at once for an extra big caffeine rush. As caffeine is rapidly absorbed, the effects may begin minutes after ingestion and last for a number of hours. Levels can go out of control. Dr van Dam told BBC News: \"Young people may have less tolerance to caffeine and there's a chance they could end up in the emergency room if they have too much.\" Caffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more alert and less sleepy due to its effect on the brain and nervous system. Lewis James, from the School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences at Loughborough University, says there is good evidence that caffeine can help make exercise feel easier. It's become one of the most regularly used supplements among athletes. As you exercise your body produces a chemical called adenosine which makes you feel tired. Caffeine blocks the adenosine receptors in your nerves, so your brain perceives less pain and fatigue. But it acts on other parts of the body too - including the cardiovascular system - which can be risky. High levels can cause a rapid heart rate, abnormal heart rhythms and seizures. Although rare, there are documented deaths from excess caffeine. Some people are more sensitive to caffeine than others and can feel nauseous, anxious and irritable, and get headaches even at lower doses. Generally, up to 400mg of caffeine a day appears to be safe for most healthy adults - that's around four cups of instant coffee. Tea contains a bit less, so five cups a day is usually fine. Pregnant women are advised to halve daily intake to 200mg or less. Children and teenagers are also more susceptible to the risks and potential for an overdose. This is why energy drinks containing over 150mg of caffeine, for example, are already required by EU law to carry labels stating: \"High caffeine content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breast-feeding women\". Dr van Dam says it can be easy to overload. Caffeine is found in many drinks and some foods, so it is important to check how much you are consuming. \"While it's harder to overdose on coffee, with these products it's easier, especially if young people are using energy drinks too.\" He says some products, when you check them in the laboratory, contain more caffeine than they claim on the labelling. Dentists say using them over time can irritate the gums - similar to snus and nicotine pouches. Some experts worry caffeine pouches could be a gateway to using these. Bini Suresh is head of dietetics at the Cleveland Clinic, London, and a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. She says using pouches may feel \"trendy\" or harmless, but there's a real risk of normalising stimulant use in teens and young adults, potentially creating patterns of dependency. She told the BBC: \"While caffeine may give a temporary boost, it can disrupt sleep and worsen fatigue over time, especially in children and teens who are more sensitive to its effects.\" If young people are going to have caffeine, the BDA and NHS both advise caution. The European Food Safety Authority suggests 3mg/kg body weight as the upper limit for children and adolescents, meaning a child weighing 30kg should have no more than 90mg in a day. Instead of reaching for caffeine, Ms Suresh says it's far better to focus on regular meals, hydration and nutrient-rich foods that support steady energy levels throughout the day. A healthy diet with enough iron, protein and slow-releasing carbohydrates should do the job, she says. The Health Improvement Commission says it would support a ban on energy drinks for under 16s. There will be a ban on unhealthy food adverts being advertised in certain public spaces and the council website. Mitchell Allsopp from the Grove School says the drinks have a 'noticeable effect' on students. Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said he was acting on concerns for children's health. Beverley Cuddy says her shopping habits have changed completely since taking Mounjaro. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

    "text": "Sleep, exercise, hydrate - do we really need to stick to recommended daily doses?. It felt like there was a collective sigh of relief when a study, published this week, suggested 10,000 steps a day isn't the health utopia we had all been led to believe. The news that we only had to reach 7,000 steps was enough to quite literally stop us in our fervent step-counting stride. So what about some of the other health targets that many of us swear by? Can we fall short of the mark but still live long, healthy and happy lives? We've taken a handful of commonly cited healthy lifestyle benchmarks, examined them with various experts to get an idea of why they exist, explored the health claims, and, most importantly asked if there is any wriggle room. Is sleep so important that we have to spend so much of our lives doing it? How much exercise is enough? What about drinking water? How much do we really need? Disclosure - the below is not medical advice, it's more of an inspection of many of the health ideals we have on our radar. According to the NHS, the average grown-up should be drinking between six and eight glasses (1.5-2 litres) of water a day. However, maybe we don't need to cart our fancy flagons around with us as much as we thought. Prof Neil Turner, kidney specialist at the University of Edinburgh, says as humans we existed for thousands of years without knowing what a pint or a litre was. \"I mean, mice don't need flashing water bottles telling them how much to drink - why do we?\" he says. \"Our bodies are set up to do things just right - we eat when we are hungry, we breathe when we need to breathe, and we drink when we are thirsty.\" Oh. Is it really that simple? According to Prof Turner, who has seen a lot of kidneys in his time, that rule applies to the vast majority of us. Those with specific conditions, like a kidney disorder, may have to drink more. He says if our urine is dark, in the general healthy population, we shouldn't panic that we haven't drunk enough - that is the kidney doing its job. It is reserving water in our body, he explains, and our body should tell us that we feel thirsty and then we will get a drink. Dr Linia Patel, a performance nutritionist, disagrees. We might drink different amounts, she says, due to factors like our size, how warm we are, whether we've been drinking alcohol, but she feels having a target of 1.5 to 2 litres is a good thing - especially for women. \"I would definitely say from a women's health point of view, where I work, what I see is a lot of the symptoms [associated] with being dehydrated. It might be fatigue, constipation, brain fog, feeling hungry [or] cravings.\" She says that if the problem is related to hydration then it's \"an easy one to get right, if you're consistent with it\". Moving on to sleep - the NHS recommends seven to nine hours a night for the average adult, and there's not much wriggle room to be had there. Prof Ama Johal, a specialist in sleep disorders from Queen Mary University of London, says sleep is vital; without it we are beginning to shave years off our lives. \"The evidence is there, there are huge bodies of research which show that the health benefits are multiple. \"A good night's sleep - that's at least seven hours of quality sleep - reduces the risk  of obesity, diabetes, depression and finally, it lowers mortality rates.\" He points to a study which used 10,000 British civil servants - those that slept for fewer than five hours a night had an increased risk of early death. But could we shave an hour off the minimum recommended - and settle for six hours a night? \"No,\" Prof Johal says. \"As soon as we lower the limit then there's a risk people will think it's ok to sleep for less time.\" Cat napping? \"Unfortunately not,\" he says, \"Our bodies have very different reactions to naps through the day, and eventually if we tried to make up the hours we were missing overnight by sleeping through the day, we would struggle to fall asleep at night.\" But all is not lost, nappers among us - there are studies that suggest a short snooze in the day can keep the brain youthful, and even compensate for poor or broken sleep the night before. Prof Johal suggests that for those who struggle to get the recommended amount, try to target a few nights of good sleep a week, and just being \"more aware that sleep is so important\". Emily and Lucy are two avid walkers from Manchester. But alongside their love of walking, the two women share a less healthy trait: they struggle to nod off because of their anxiety. But they say the target of seven hours sleep a night is something they \"are working towards\". Emily and Lucy are, however, \"definitely nailing it\" when it comes to exercise. Through their group, Soft Girls who Hike, they have found a love of walking which has not only improved their mental health, they say, but connected them with many other women. They don't try to meet all the healthy benchmarks on their radar, they explain, because \"life just gets in the way\". But they are doing 7,000 steps a day and taking long, low impact walks at the weekend. The Chief Medical Officer recommends doing 150 minutes of exercise a week and two strength training sessions. Is that achievable for most? Dr Sinead Roberts, a sports nutritionist who trains elite athletes, is pragmatic in her approach. While moderate strength training and physical activity are vital for maintaining muscle mass, she says, as well as resistance to injuries and supporting our immune systems, you have to adapt the recommendations to fit with your life. \"Rules are for the obedience of fools and the guidance of wise people,\" she says. \"This phrase really does apply here. \"I have friends who do nothing - and that really does show, I say, 'You're walking like an 80-year-old!' \"But if you are doing one strength session a week and some moderate exercise then that is definitely a good thing, just try and do more if you can.\" She uses an analogy of a highway - the more things we can do to stay healthy the wider the road, which, in turn means we can go off course sometimes without careering up a grassy verge. \"All those benchmarks are interlinked - you can't just do one healthy thing and ignore the rest. Equally you don't need to put so much pressure on yourself to achieve them all.\" This attitude chimes with Emily and Lucy, who say they happily \"chip away\" at some of the health benchmarks. \"For example, we might do five minutes of meditation [which is] better than nothing, but we wouldn't stress about not hitting the recommended goal.\" Through its Every Mind Matters campaign, the NHS recommends 10 minutes of mindfulness a day. Basically, instead of pondering the future or thinking about the past, you pay attention to the moment, noticing what is going on inside and outside ourselves, letting our thoughts pass by without judgement. Some studies suggest activities like mindfulness can have a positive effect and also help change the structure of the brain. Psychologist Natasha Tiwari, founder of The Veda Group, says 10 minutes is a good start to \"give the mind time to settle, and the brain enough time to truly benefit\" from the process of mindfulness. But many of us lead busy lives, and to carve out 10 minutes in the day can be a luxury. In some respects, could having these targets make life more stressful? Ms Tiwari disagrees - it's less about the time spent and more about the awareness of mindfulness and bringing it to our everyday lives. \"Even brief pauses,\" she explains, \"can still have a positive impact\". Most experts I've spoken to agree that while benchmarks are useful, and simplicity is key, it's better not to fixate on a number. Rather, find a way to incorporate a healthy outlook to diet, exercise and mental health into everyday life. After sitting for some time writing this, I am going to sign off - there is another health benchmark I've just come across: limiting sitting down to less than eight hours a day. So, I had better get moving. Additional reporting by George Sandeman Morgan Betchley was \"brutalised\" by Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, her mother-in-law says. More than 2,000 NHS patients have been treated with UK-donated blood plasma since a ban was lifted.
